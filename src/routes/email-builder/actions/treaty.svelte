	I would like to ask you to work towards a treaty that prevents the worst of the risks that AI
	poses, and propose this draft at the upcoming Seoul AI Safety Summit in May. One country should
	take the lead, and at this moment, not a single one is doing so.

	The most important part of such a document is that there should be some mechanism in place that
	can pause dangerous training runs. Ideally, this happens before a model is trained, as AI
	accidents might happen during lab tests.
