description: Set up a table and talk to people about AI risks and why we need to pause.

One of the most direct ways to have an impact, is by convincing people one-on-one.
By setting up a table in public ([example](https://x.com/ChrisGerrby/status/1837537928748351611)), and inviting people to talk to you, you can reach a lot of people in a short amount of time.
This not only increases awareness, but is also a great way to recruit new people to PauseAI.

## Preparation

- **Table**: You need a table to put your materials on. A folding table is ideal, but any table will do.
- **Chairs**: You need chairs for yourself and any volunteers.
- **Materials**: [Flyers](/flyering) are especially useful to hand out to others.
- **Sign / banner**: Have a piece of cardboard or cloth that catches attention of bystanders and invites interaction: "AI could lead to human extinction. Change my mind." or something similar.
- **Location**: Choose a location with a lot of foot traffic. A busy street corner, a park, or a university campus are all good options.
- **Find a buddy**: It's more fun to table with company. You can take turns talking to people, and keep each other company if you're not getting a lot of attention.
- **Film & share**: If you can, film your interactions and share them on social media. Consider doing a livestream. If you can't edit videos, we can help you with that.
- **Share your idea on the Discord**: Let us know what your plan is, so we can help and join!

## While tabling

- **Engage**: Be friendly and approachable. Smile and make eye contact.
- **Ask questions**: Ask people what they know about AI, and what they think about it. This will help you tailor your message to their concerns.
