## AI Safety should be the focus of the Paris AI Action Summit!

On the 10th and 11th of February this year, politicians from around the world including the USA, China, UK, Canada and France as well as global experts in AI will be gathering in Paris for the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit. Without a focus on safety, **the summit will be a lost opportunity to protect our common future**. We are protesting around the world to shift main focus onto AI Safety!

- **PauseAI wants to ensure the Summit attendees and organizers know that Safety is the most important issue for discussion\!**

- **We hope you will stand with us in February to send a clear message to the organizers and the delegates!**

## Why are we protesting, and what are we asking the organizer and the delegates to do!

The organizers of the Paris summit have created an agenda that will cover public interest, the future of work, innovation and culture, trust in AI, and global governance **— but they have given very little time to AI Safety.**

- It is a mistake to deprioritize AI-safety and AI risk.
- The rapid advancement of AI capabilities in recent years makes it urgently required that world leaders start collaborating on mitigating the serious and [existential risks](https://www.safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk) posed by increasingly powerful AI-systems to ensure our common future
- AI Safety needs to be the focus at the Paris AI Action Summit!

**We propose that the organizers and the government delegates at the summit makes AI Safety the focus of the summit by working on the following:**

- Collaborating on creating global treaties and regulations to mitigate serious and existential risks from AI, and reign in the companies and organizations racing to build ever more capable and dangerous AI systems.
- Planning the establishment of international bodies to enforce such treaties and regulations
- Sharing and reviewing best practices on how each nation can contribute to the challenge of protecting the world that we share.

## Join PauseAI — the organization behind this protest

PauseAI Global is an organization of volunteers located across the globe seeking to implement a pause on the training of
AI systems more powerful than the most advanced AI, until we know how to build them safely and keep them under human control.
Our members coordinate to make sure the development of AI systems is understood and discussed in the public sphere, so that we can all influence our decision-makers to pause development until safety is a priority.
