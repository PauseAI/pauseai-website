## Join the PauseAI movement and take action against AI's risks today! We have an urgent need for people to help us with any of the following:

(Updated Jul 17)

**If you’re breathing (five minute tasks anyone can do):**
- [Send an email about AI’s risks to all your elected officials simultaneously](https://democracy.io/). If you don’t know what to say, use [our email builder](https://pauseai.info/email-builder).
- Join [our in-person monthly meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957) each month on the 11th.
- Join our online NYC community in the following locations: [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1223374237016784928), [Whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KAQMwz2nQeWIkTLxwKxHg1) We mostly use Discord for now, but let us know if you want alternative communication.
- Follow PauseAINYC on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pauseainyc/)

**If you like to socialize:**
- Sign up for one of [our events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/pause-ai-nyc-83065324363). We do everything from public demonstrations in front of AI companies to attending networking sessions with related organizations.
- Set up a meeting with [your local political official](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) to discuss AI risks. [Copy us by email](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) and we'll support your engagement. Alternatively, finding an official in your state or region who works directly on AI legislation may be more productive.

**If you’re good at posting and networking on social media:**
- [Attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957), or send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience. We’re specifically looking for people who can connect with other technology risk communities and expand our reach as an organization on social media. Design skills are less relevant at the moment, since we have some of that covered.
- For less of a commitment, showing appreciation for the PauseAINYC posts through likes, supportive comments, and follows is also appreciated

**If you’re good at web development:**
- [Attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957), or send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience. We're looking for people to write and potentially help host our own separate website (that doesn't cost a million dollars from a web host provider).

**If you’re good at photography, videography, and/or media production:**
- We're always looking for more people to help us capture our public demonstrations and spread the message. Sign up for one of [our events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/pause-ai-nyc-83065324363). 

**If you want to provide financial support:**
- You can [donate here](https://pauseai.info/donate). Your donations are tax-deductible (if you itemize), and all donations go directly to people and projects addressing the dangers of AI.
- Alternatively, you can directly fund specific projects, such as t-shirt printing costs or funds to help members travel to protest together.
