## Join the PauseAI movement and take action today! We have an urgent need for people to help us with any of the following:

**If you’re breathing:**
- [Send an email about AI’s risks to all your elected officials at once](https://democracy.io/). If you don’t know what to say, use [our email builder](https://pauseai.info/email-builder).
- Join [our in-person monthly meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957) each month on the 11th.
- Join our online NYC community in the following locations: [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1223374237016784928), [Whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KAQMwz2nQeWIkTLxwKxHg1)

**If you like to socialize:**
- Sign up for one of [our events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/pause-ai-nyc-83065324363). We do everything from public demonstrations in front of AI companies to attending networking sessions with related organizations.
- Set up a meeting with a political official to discuss AI risks.

**If you’re good at posting and networking on social media:**
- Send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience, or [attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957). We’re specifically looking for people who can connect with other technology risk communities and expand our reach as an organization. Design skills are less relevant at the moment.

**If you’re good at web development:**
- Send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience, or [attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957). We're looking for people to write and potentially help host our own seperate website (that doesn't cost a million dollars from a web host provider).

**If you’re good at photography, videography, and/or media production:**
- We're always looking for more people to help us capture our public demonstrations and spread the message. Sign up for one of [our events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/pause-ai-nyc-83065324363). 

**If you want to provide financial support:**
- You can [donate here](https://pauseai.info/donate). Your donations are tax-deductible (if you itemize), and all donations go directly to people and projects addressing the dangers of AI.
