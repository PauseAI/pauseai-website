## **Role description**

As PauseAI’s French Lead Organizer, you will be the point person for implementation of strategy in France, and leading growth and coordination of our volunteer base at a national level. You will be responsible for establishing PauseAI as a significant voice in the French AI governance landscape while building a robust network of local chapters and activists. 

You will work closely with the PauseAI Global leadership team (including other national lead organizers) and be responsible to our Global Organizing Director. 

This role operates within the established Pause IA France association, which has existing governance, teams, and strategic direction. The successful candidate will:

- Integrate into the current organizational structure and work collaboratively with existing volunteer leadership
- Build upon and refine the existing strategy rather than creating new direction from scratch
- Coordinate closely with the French bureau (board) while maintaining reporting lines to PauseAI Global
- Strengthen the volunteer-driven culture that has been established

Key Responsibilities:

- **Regional Leadership:** Act as the primary coordinator and point of contact for all PauseAI activities across France. 
- **Campaign Coordination**: Plan and execute national campaigns, demonstrations and advocacy efforts and align these with international efforts, specifically across the European Union. 
- **Community Building:** PauseAI is a grassroots organization and your success will be defined in large part by the number of active and engaged members you can help to recruit and coordinate.
- **Chapter Development and Leader Mentoring**: Establish, support and manage local PauseAI groups in cities. Train and mentor volunteer leaders to become effective recruiters and organizers in their own right. 
- **Policy Engagement**: Engage with French parliamentarians, civil servants and regulatory bodies on AI governance issues. 
- **Event Management**: Assist in coordinating future France and Europe-based PauseCon events, as well as organizing events such as protests, workshops, lobby meetings and social events for membership. 
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Build productive and collaborative relationships with French-based AI safety organisations, academic institutions, and policy groups
- **Media Relations**: Serve as French spokesperson for PauseAI and coordinate with national and local media outlets, alongside our Global Communications Director.

Desired Skills and Attributes:

- Proven leadership in community organizing or activism contexts. Volunteer management experience, demonstrated mentorship of leaders. 
- Excellent communication skills on camera and in public speaking. Ideally some media relations experience. 
- Understanding of the French political system and policy-making process. Ideally understanding of the European Union policy-making process.
- Strategically minded and able to build flexible but actionable plans. 
- Project management abilities with experience coordinating teams. 
- Ability to work effectively within established volunteer structure.
- Collaborative leadership style that empowers existing teams.
- Understanding of AI safety issues and support for an international Pause treaty solution. 
- Fluency in English is required for international coordination. 

Conditions:

- 12-month fixed term contract with the possibility of extension
- Paris based or with the ability to travel frequently
- Salary range of €45,000-60,000 depending on experience
