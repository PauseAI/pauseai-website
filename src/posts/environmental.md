title: Environmental impact of AI
description: AI's environmental impact is a problem not just because of the immediate human cost, but because robots are fantastically energy-hungry and thus accelerate the unsustainable, insupportable damage we are doing to Earth.

Immediate harms are intense.

Corporations feed our friends and family’s data into AI.
Corporations refine AI to cheaply replace our long-time colleagues.
Corporations sell bots used to manipulate and target us.

It’s easy to miss AI’s most diffuse harm—to our [environment](https://ainowinstitute.org/spotlight/climate).

## Burning energy

One AI model can gobble up more electricity than [100 US homes use in one year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure?sref=ixwpc5OO#xj4y7vzkg) – just to learn how to predict the next sentences from our online conversations.
To generate those next sentences in replies to users, ChatGPT burns as much electricity as [a small city](https://archive.ph/20230917070741/https://kaspergroesludvigsen.medium.com/chatgpts-electricity-consumption-pt-ii-225e7e43f22b).

By 2027, all AI may burn as much energy as [a nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/climate/ai-could-soon-need-as-much-electricity-as-an-entire-country.html), just to process our data in data centers.

Data centers that suck billions of liters of [drinking water](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center), to cool AI’s overheating hardware.
Data centers that emit trillions of tons of carbon dioxide, warming our global atmosphere.

Yet data centers are only one stage—of AI’s lifecycle.

## Hidden toxicity

Today’s AI is not alive, of course. AI is not near yet to the free-roaming robots we see in movies.
AI is stuck running in data centers, on hardware that wears and gets replaced every ~4 years.

But producing that hardware takes [hundreds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237170/#!po=17.9245) of [cancerous chemicals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/american-chipmakers-had-a-toxic-problem-so-they-outsourced-it).
Materials were molten and reassembled at blazing hot temperatures. Those materials were in turn extracted from mines, using drills and dissolving acids.

Environmental scientists investigate all these stages. They call it the ‘hardware lifecycle’ of AI.

We don’t see those [mines](https://e360.yale.edu/features/china-wrestles-with-the-toxic-aftermath-of-rare-earth-mining), [refineries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eVsQSn_EWc), [production plants](https://sci-hub.wf/10.1080/10455752.2010.546647), [data centers](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-staggering-ecological-impacts-of-computation-and-the-cloud/) and [waste dumps](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352186421006970#d1e1833).
We don’t see the bulldozed lands, the hellish infernos, the toxic chemicals, the climate gasses.

AI is toxic to our environment. Corporations hide the toxicity, out of our sight.

## This boom is different

Fortunately, climate activists are waking up to the fact that AI burns a helluva lot of energy.
Even OpenAI’s CEO admitted that “we still don't appreciate the energy needs of this technology”.
States are now forced to keep [old coal plants running](https://futurism.com/the-byte/coal-plants-ai).

Climate activists are quicker on their feet this time. Years before, another tech boom started:|
Cryptocurrencies. Hardware slurped ~[0.5%](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Crypto%2Dasset%20activity%20in%20the,railroads%20in%20the%20United%20States.) of US energy to compute crypto. It got so bad that Texas gave away [millions in tax dollars](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-cryptocurrency-riot-texas-power-grid/) so a bitcoin company would halt on draining electricity.

But here is the crucial difference:

- Crypto-currencies go bust. Besides as an alternative to dollars, they produce little value.
- AI models can be used to automate economic production.

AI is ideal for centralizing power.
AI to extract, to exploit, to extract.

## The vicious cycle

Corporations extract profit using untested bots.
To reinvest in more toxic hardware factories.
To build more energy-slurping data centers.
To feed more of our free data into AI.
To cheaply automate more work.
To extract more profit.

This is a vicious cycle.

After two centuries of competition for scaling resource-intensive machines, society is already close to [collapsing](https://youtu.be/vi166hJv6Qk).
To protect society, why don’t we ease up on excessive corporate tech?

AI corporations accelerate our climate collapse.
They scale machine models to predict human behavior and gradually automate the work needed to re-produce [more machines](https://rupertread.net/writings/2022/climate-crisis-and-the-dangers-of-tech-obsessed-long-termism/).

## Automated extinction

What comes if we let this continue?
Auto-scaling machines.

A technology more destructive than any auto-catalytic technology ever invented.
Worse than chain reactions inside nuclear bombs that a president could ignite with a button.
Worse than computer-engineered viruses that replicate inside our human bodies.

A technology scaling automatically, in runaway feedback with themselves, [outside any control](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xp6n2MG5vQkPpFEBH/the-control-problem-unsolved-or-unsolvable).
Machines that learn and evolve to scale themselves. A machine ecosystem that gobbles up the resources we need to live while morphing our environment into a toxic hellscape.

Humans started the [sixth mass-extinction](https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-is-the-sixth-mass-extinction-and-what-can-we-do-about-it), wiping out thousands of animal species.
[AI can take extinction all the way](xrisk).

## Act now!

- _Easy_: Listen to [researchers](https://shows.acast.com/the-data-fix/episodes/empathy-with-steven-gonzalez-monserrate) investigating AI’s lifecycle pollution.
- _Medium_: Talk with [climate activists](https://rebellion.global/) about shared concerns.
- _Hardcore_: Organize a [shared protest](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2022/11/02/big-techs-new-headache-data-centre-activism-flourishes-across-the-world/) to block an AI data center.
