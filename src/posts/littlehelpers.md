Volunteers like Maxime, Raluca, and Mark are the heartbeat of PauseAI—from organizing protests in Paris to building chapters across four continents.

A €175/month stipend transforms a volunteer who can squeeze in a few hours on weekends into someone who can dedicate real time to this work. It's the difference between sending a few emails and leading a chapter, between attending one meeting and coordinating with policymakers.

In December 2025, we showcased their work in videos - you'll find them on our social media channels, and with the help of generous donation matching we met our goal to raise €21,000 to fund stipends for at least ten volunteers throughout 2026.

Thanks to all!
