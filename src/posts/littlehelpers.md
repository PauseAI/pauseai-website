Volunteers like Maxime, Raluca, and Mark are the heartbeat of PauseAI—from organizing protests in Paris to building chapters across four continents. This December, we're showcasing their work in daily videos.

A €175/month stipend transforms a volunteer who can squeeze in a few hours on weekends into someone who can dedicate real time to this work. It's the difference between sending a few emails and leading a chapter, between attending one meeting and coordinating with policymakers.

We're raising €21,000 to fund stipends for at least ten volunteers throughout 2026. Any funds beyond this goal will support volunteer microgrants.

**Generous donors have pledged to match contributions through Christmas.**

Help us grow this movement. Give the gift of dedicated advocacy this holiday season—become a Little Helper yourself.
