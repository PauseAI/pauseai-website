title: PauseAI Protesters Code of Conduct
---

As a participant in a PauseAI protest, I commit to adhering to the following Code of Conduct to ensure a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all:

1. **Nonviolence**: I pledge to maintain a peaceful and nonviolent demeanor during the protest. I will not engage in any form of physical or verbal aggression, nor will I instigate or provoke others to do so. Violence is the quickest way to undermine our message and jeopardize our cause.
2. **Respect**: I commit to treating all individuals, including fellow protesters, law enforcement, and bystanders, with respect and dignity. I will refrain from using offensive language or making derogatory remarks, and I will respect the rights of others to express their opinions, even if they differ from my own.
3. **Safety**: I understand the importance of ensuring the safety of all participants and will follow established guidelines and protocols to maintain a secure environment. I will report any potential hazards or threatening behavior to protest organizers or law enforcement immediately.
4. **Inclusivity**: I pledge to create an inclusive atmosphere, welcoming individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. I will be mindful of my own biases and assumptions, and I will strive to actively listen and learn from others.
5. **Solidarity**: I commit to standing in solidarity with the PauseAI movement and its goals. I will avoid actions or statements that may undermine the message or reputation of the movement, and I will actively support my fellow protesters in their efforts to promote responsible AI development.
6. **Compliance with Laws**: I understand that I am responsible for complying with all applicable local, regional, and national laws during the protest. I will cooperate with law enforcement officials and follow their instructions, as long as they do not conflict with my rights or safety.
7. **Responsibility**: I acknowledge my personal responsibility to uphold the values and goals of the PauseAI movement. If I witness any violation of this Code of Conduct, I will report it to protest organizers or other appropriate authorities.
8. **Action over doom**: I will focus on constructive dialogue and promoting actionable solutions to address the challenges posed by AI development. This approach will create a more empowering and hopeful atmosphere, encouraging others to join our cause.

By adhering to this Code of Conduct, I pledge to be an ambassador for the PauseAI movement and its mission to promote the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence. Together, we can create a powerful and positive force for change.
