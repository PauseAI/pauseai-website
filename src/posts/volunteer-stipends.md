The PauseAI volunteer stipend program supports volunteers who contribute regularly to the PauseAI Global community. It is not a salary or wage—it is a contribution toward the costs associated with volunteering (such as internet, travel, materials, or event costs).

If you're planning a one-off project or event, consider applying for a [Microgrant](/microgrants) instead.

## Criteria and Rules

### Purpose and Structure

- Stipends are intended to support volunteers who contribute regularly to PauseAI Global community work over a sustained period (typically six months).
- Stipend amounts and payment mechanisms vary by country of residence to ensure compliance with local regulations. See the [Stipend Amounts by Country](#stipend-amounts-by-country) section below.

### Eligibility Requirements

- Volunteers must have signed up via our [PauseAI Global webform](/join).
- Volunteers who are US citizens or residents should contact [PauseAI US](https://www.pauseai-us.org/), which manages volunteers separately.
- Volunteers should be contributing regularly to PauseAI Global activities.
- Preference is given to volunteers with a demonstrated history of consistent contributions.

### Strategic Allocation

- Stipend positions are limited by PauseAI Global's available budget.
- Allocation decisions are made in alignment with PauseAI Global's overall strategy.
- Allocations may not be distributed evenly across regions or chapters.
- Priority is given to volunteers whose work demonstrates high impact potential for the mission.

### Application Process

- Our Global leadership team will make final decisions and inform applicants within 1 month.
- Chapter-based stipends require coordination with chapter leadership.
- Approved applicants must sign the Stipend Agreement.

## Stipend Amounts by Country

The stipend amount and mechanism depend on your country of residence:

| Country         | Monthly Amount | Mechanism                                 |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Netherlands     | Up to €175     | Flat monthly payment                      |
| Belgium         | Up to €140     | Flat monthly payment                      |
| France          | Up to €135     | Flat monthly payment                      |
| Germany         | Up to €70      | Flat monthly payment                      |
| Other countries | Up to €175     | Expense reimbursement (receipts required) |

For countries using **expense reimbursement**, volunteers submit receipts for costs incurred through their volunteering (internet, travel, printing, event costs, etc.) via [this form](https://pauseai-global.notion.site/43a64147b37e41839a8dc09cf878ce25?pvs=105) and are reimbursed up to the monthly cap. Unreimbursed months do not roll over.

## Tax Responsibility

Tax treatment of volunteer stipends varies significantly by jurisdiction. **Recipients are solely responsible for understanding and meeting any tax obligations** that may apply in their country of residence. PauseAI cannot provide tax advice.

## Accountability and Reporting

- Stipend recipients are required to meet monthly with either the Organizing Director or the appropriate National Chapter Director to discuss progress and goals.
- Continued stipend receipt is subject to ongoing contribution and alignment with PauseAI Global priorities.
- Stipends may be terminated if the stipend agreement is not honoured.
