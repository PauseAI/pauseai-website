description: How to apply for a volunteer stipend
---

The PauseAI volunteer stipend program is a way to support volunteers who contribute to the PauseAI community.
It's not a salary, but it can help cover some of your costs (including your time).
If you're planning on doing a one-off large event, or a time-bound project, consider applying for a [Microgrant](/microgrants) instead.

## Conditions

- 175 EUR per month for 6 months for a minimum average of 8 hours a week.
- No US citizens or residents ([PauseAI US](https://www.pauseai-us.org/) manages US volunteers)
- Should cover your time as well as other expenses (travel, flyers, events). We are not legally allowed to reimburse additional costs.
- Tax free in the Netherlands, but it could be that you have to pay taxes in your country of residence
