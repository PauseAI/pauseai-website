description: How to apply for a volunteer stipend
---

The PauseAI volunteer stipend program is a way to support volunteers who contribute to the PauseAI community.
It's not a salary, but it can help cover some of your costs (including your time).
If you're planning on doing a one-off large event, or a time-bound project, consider applying for a [Microgrant](/microgrants) instead.
