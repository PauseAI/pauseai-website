**Replaced human employment, creating few new jobs**

[Goldman Sachs Report](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america)
"By 2030, activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated — a trend accelerated by generative AI."
[McKinsey Report](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america)
"...we find that roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and that generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work. Extrapolating our estimates globally suggests that generative AI could expose the equivalent of 300mn full-time jobs to automation."

**Influenced elections and bolstered surveillance states**

[Large language models can consistently generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06731}
"Almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time."
