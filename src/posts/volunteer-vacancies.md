## Outreach team member

- Help PauseAI reach new communities, attract members and spread awareness
- This is something you can do independently in your spare time, with little need for coordination with others
- Come up with campaigns of people you would like to reach out to, and contact them (whether by email, phone, DM, or in-person)
- Please consider joining if you have a non traditional background or location - this could help us to reach new groups!

## Software Team member

- Empower everyone else, giving folk the help they need &amp; the freedom they want.
- Advise &amp; assist on the technology choices teams make, and keep things running.
- Be strategic: keep things simple &amp; scalable, buy not build unless we have to...
- ...but sometimes we have to! So step up devs: scratch an itch and save the world.
