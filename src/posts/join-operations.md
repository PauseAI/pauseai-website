title: Join the Operations Team
description: How to get involved with PauseAI's operations team — website, tooling, and technology.
---

## What we do

We build and maintain the PauseAI website and other parts of our technology stack (tooling etc.), and advise other teams on technology choices. We have [unusual scaling requirements](https://tinyurl.com/pauseaitechandscaling), and we buy rather than build in most cases.

The main website is mostly static, using SvelteKit with clientside hydration, Node, and Markdown, deployed through Netlify.

Yes, we are happy to use language models to accelerate our development.

## Get started

Browse our code and open issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/PauseAI).

The best way to get an idea of what any team does is to read recent messages in their Discord channel. To unlock [#operations-team](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1222902730083799120):

1. Fill in the [join form](/join) — make sure you read and confirm the volunteer agreement. This grants you the volunteer role on Discord.
2. Visit the [pinned post in #volunteers](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1185555491024273489/1288188514701148174) and click the button to grant yourself the "view team channels" role.
3. Join [#operations-team](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1222902730083799120).

If you can't see #volunteers, you don't have the volunteer role on Discord yet. You can either fill in the [join form](/join) again (making sure to confirm the volunteer agreement this time), or ask whoever onboarded you to set the role for you.

## Get in touch

- **Book a chat** with our current operations lead: [antb.me/meet](http://antb.me/meet)
- **Come to a meeting** — Wednesdays 5-6pm UTC on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/nxa-rwko-sog)

If you already have a CV, LinkedIn, or website that tells us something about your experience, by all means link it — but don't feel like you need to write one.

## What helps

Any of these can be learned — none are blockers to signing up:

- Web development (SvelteKit, Node, Markdown)
- Self-directed and able to work asynchronously
- Bias for action and ideas — we validate choices in review
- Previous experience with open source development helps — all the usual challenges are amplified in a volunteer org context

## Volunteer details

- Active team members typically contribute 2-5 hours per week, but we welcome one-off bug fixes and sporadic contributions too — no minimum commitment required.
