## What a PauseAI National Groups does

- Manage, coach and coordinate their own [local communities](/communities).
- Organize national events.
- Are responsible for national-level strategy and coordination.
- Typically have their own website, social media accounts and legal entity.
- Do national-level lobbying and media outreach.
- At this point, most national groups are _volunteer-run,_ exceptions are the USA, France and the United Kingdom.

## What PauseAI Global provides

- **Digital infrastructure** which involves things like signing up for the newsletter, joining the discord server, onboarding volunteers, etc.
- **Funding** for national-level activities. National groups can apply for [Microgrants](/microgrants) from PauseAI Global to fund all sorts of activities. Still, national groups are encouraged to fundraise for their own activities.
- **Coaching** and **monitoring** to ensure national groups are successful and aligned with the global strategy.
- **Marketing materials** like flyers, posters, social media content, etc.
- **Strategy**. National groups are expected to follow the PauseAI strategy ([Theory of Change](/theory-of-change) and [Communication Strategy](/communication-strategy). However, national groups are expected to make modifications to the strategy to fit their local context.

## How to set up a PauseAI National Group

## **Phase 1: Foundation**

_Focus: Connect with Global, define your vision, assign roles_

### **Connect with PauseAI Global**

**Email the Organizing Director** at ella@pauseai.info to express interest in starting a chapter.

We will:

- Host an initial meeting with you
- Contact all signed-up members and volunteers from your country
- Help you build an initial chapter team
- Help you decide your early strategy and launch plan

### **Define Your Chapter Vision**

Discuss with your founding team:

- Why is AI safety advocacy important in your country specifically?
- What unique opportunities exist in your national context?
- What barriers do you anticipate?
- Where do you want the chapter to be in 12 months?

Use this to construct your National strategy plan. 

### **Assign Initial Roles**

Every chapter needs these core functions covered (one person can hold multiple roles):

- National Lead: Overall coordination, Global liaison
- Communications Lead: Social media, messaging, media outreach
- Organizing Lead: Recruitment, volunteer coordination, events

## **Phase 2: Infrastructure**

_Focus: Create materials, set up platforms_

### **Create Materials**

- **Logo**: Use the[ PauseAI Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/iQ4PHQTi1vAVmT9Lckazqt/PauseAI-designs---editable) (includes country examples)
- **Flyers**: Adapt from Figma or[ public Drive templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bQ_MZ8giK-Mee4ABkO0BgcFInaXruNpa)
- **Website**: Choose one approach:
- - Page on pauseai.info (e.g.,[ ](https://claude.ai/nyc-action)[PauseAI Australia](https://pauseai.info/australia))

  - Clone the[ GitHub repo](https://github.com/PauseAI/pauseai-website) and translate

  - Custom site (like[ PauseIA France](https://pauseia.fr/))

### **Set Up Communication Channels**

**Internal team chat**: WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or Discord — choose what's popular in your country

**Social media**: Prioritize 1-2 platforms relevant to your audience

- Consider: X, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok
- Use a scheduling tool like Buffer
- Read the [Communication Strategy](https://pauseai.info/communication-strategy) for messaging guidance

## **Phase 3: Launch**

_Focus: Plan recruitment, schedule first activities_

### **Plan Recruitment**

**Target communities:**

### **Schedule First Month Activities**

To meet our programming requirements, plan:

- Strategic Meetings: your core leadership will come together to plan and coordinate
- Growth goal: set an objective to achieve X amount of new sign-ups
- Signature collection: decide how you will collect 20 or more signatures to our [statement](https://pauseai.info/statement)

### Difference between a Local Community and a National Chapter

Local Community: Informal group, no formal structure, uses PauseAI resources with permission

National Chapter: Formal leadership, signed MOU, meets baseline programming, approved foundational documents

Path: Individual → Group → Community → Chapter → Legal entity (optional)

If activity drops: After 3 months of not meeting baseline without communication, Global Organizing Director will reach out. Chapter may transition to Community status or receive support to rebuild.

### Required Roles

National Lead (required for Chapter status):

- Manages the national strategy
- Manages reporting, fundraising, and all other roles
- Primary contact with Global
- Participates in campaign specific coordination

Communications Lead (required for Chapter status):

- Manages national social media accounts aligned with campaign messaging
- Participates in fortnightly Global Communications calls
- Coordinates messaging with Global Communications Director
- Primary contact for national press
- Implements campaign communications strategies
