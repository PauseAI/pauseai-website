## How to set up a PauseAI National Group

1.  Create a `#project` in the PauseAI discord to describe what you're planning on doing
2.  Reach out to the Oversight team at PauseAI global. They can help with funding, support, materials. They'll give you an `countryname@pauseai.info` email address.
3.  Create materials
    1.  **Logo**, you can use [the figma](https://www.figma.com/design/iQ4PHQTi1vAVmT9Lckazqt/PauseAI-designs---editable) which contains some examples for other countries
    1.  **Flyer** (again, figma!). Ask for help if you need it. More flyers can be found in the [public drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1bQ_MZ8giK-Mee4ABkO0BgcFInaXruNpa)
    1.  **Website**? You can do this in three ways:
        1.  Wait until PauseAI.info offers automated translations. Perhaps you can have your own page on the pauseai.info website. E.g. [PauseAI NYC](/nyc-action).
        2.  Clone the PauseAI github repo, translate it and adjust to taste! We can help host it if needed.
        3.  Make your own custom website, like [PauseIA](https://pauseia.fr/) did
4.  Set up internal communication channel / group chat
    1.  e.g. WhatsApp / Signal / Telegram / Discord.
    2.  Choose something popular to maximize engagement
5.  Set up **Social media accounts**. (e.g. X, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok)
    1.  Consider which tools are important for your country and target audience.
    2.  Consider a tool like Buffer to schedule posts. Look at PauseAI X posts for inspiration. You can plan a whole list in one go!
    3.  Read the [Communication Strategy](/communication-strategy) for more tips.
    4.  Take inspiration from accounts like [ControlAI](https://x.com/ai_ctrl/) (great video shorts, good tone) and [AISafetyMemes](https://x.com/AISafetyMemes) (uses humor, visually engaging).
6.  **Recruitment**. Get people to join your group.
    1.  Find people in relevant groups (EA, AI safety)
    2.  Take advantage of any networking events
    3.  Launch event
        1.  Maxime did this for PauseIA FR
        2.  Rent a nice location a few months in advance
        3.  Invite good speakers, journalists, relevant people, potential volunteers
        4.  Get reimbursed for the costs by PauseAI
        5.  This is how you can get know quickly!
    4.  [Local Organizing Guide](/local-organizing) has some advice on recruitment which may transfer well to national level
7.  Set up **activities**
    1.  Posting things to your socials
    2.  [Flyering](/flyering) / [Tabling](/tabling) (especially in student group fairs at college campuses, also great for recruitment)
    3.  Workshops (e.g. lobby workshop, protest workshop)
    4.  Lobbying directly
    5.  Media outreach / journalist outreach
    6.  Protesting
        1.  Perhaps in multiple cities, or one larger in one location
        2.  [Read more here](/organizing-a-protest)
