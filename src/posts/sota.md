How smart are the latest AI models compared to humans?
Let's take a look at how the most competent AI systems compare with humans in various domains.
The list below is regularly updated to reflect the latest developments.

_Last update: 2024-09-16_

## Superhuman (Better than all humans)

- **Games**: For many games ([Chess, Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero), Starcraft, Dota, [Gran Turismo](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/19/1056176/sonys-racing-ai-destroyed-its-human-competitors-by-being-nice-and-fast/) etc.) the best AI is better than the best human.
- **Working memory**: An average human can remember about 7 items (such as numbers) at a time. Gemini 1.5 Pro [can read and remember 99% of 7 million words](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#sundar-note).
- **Reading speed**: A model like Gemini 1.5 Pro can read an entire book in 30 seconds. It can learn an entirely new language and translate texts in half a minute.
- **Writing speed**: AI models can write at speeds far surpassing any human, writing entire computer programmes in seconds.
- **Amount of knowledge**: Modern LLMs know far more than any human, its knowledge spanning virtually every domain. There is no human whose knowledge breadth comes close.

## Better than most humans

- **Writing**: In December 2023, an AI-written novel won an award at a [science fiction national competition](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3245725/chinese-professor-used-ai-write-science-fiction-novel-then-it-won-national-award?campaign=3245725&module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article). The professor who used the AI crafted the narrative from a draft of 43,000 characters generated in just three hours with 66 prompts. The best language models have superhuman vocabulary and can write in many different styles.
- **Translating**: And they can respond and translate to all major languages fluently.
- **Creativity**: Better than 99% of humans on the [Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-creativity-23585/) where relevant and useful ideas need to be generated. However, the tests were relatively small and for larger projects (e.g. setting up a new business) AI is not autonomous enough yet.
- **Reasoning**: o1 [correctly answers 78%](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) of GPQA diamond questions, outperforming human domain experts (PhDs) who only get 69.7%.
- **Persuasion**: GPT-4 with access to personal information was able to increase participants' agreement with their opponents' arguments by a remarkable [81.7 percent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14380) compared to debates between humans - almost twice as persuasive as the human debaters.
- **IQ tests**: With verbal IQ tests, LLMs have been outperforming 95 to 99% of humans for a while (score between [125](https://medium.com/@soltrinox/the-i-q-of-gpt4-is-124-approx-2a29b7e5821e) and [155](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/i-gave-chatgpt-an-iq-test-heres-what-i-discovered/)). With non-verbal (pattern matching) IQ tests, the 2024 o1-preview model scored [120 on the mensa test](https://www.maximumtruth.org/p/massive-breakthrough-in-ai-intelligence), beating 91% of humans.
- **Specialized knowledge**: GPT-4 Scores 75% in the [Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), humans on average between [65 and 75%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/420438/). It scores better than [68](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4441311) to [90%](https://law.stanford.edu/2023/04/19/gpt-4-passes-the-bar-exam-what-that-means-for-artificial-intelligence-tools-in-the-legal-industry/) of law students on the bar exam.
- **Art**: Image generation models have won [art](https://dataconomy.com/2022/09/26/ai-artwork-wins-art-competition) and even [photography contests](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/ai-generated-image-world-photography-organization-contest-artist-declines-award-1234664549).
- **Research**: GPT-4 can do [autonomous chemical research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0) and DeepMind has built an AI that has [found a solution to an open mathematical problem](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6). However, these architectures require a lot of human engineering and are not general.
- **Programming**: o1 beats [93% of human coders](https://medium.com/@marcelinohambali/tech-review-openai-o1-strawberry-a-new-phd-reasoning-model-783e88734d84) in the Codeforces competition. AI models can write code in almost every programming language. Devin can solve [13% of coding Issues](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000) and can [earn money on Upwork](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548768734294113).
- **Hacking**: GPT-4 can [autonomously hack websites](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.06664v1) and [beats 89% of hackers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11814.pdf) in a Capture-the-Flag competition. Luckily, SOTA models still fail essential tasks required for autonomous self-replication (see below).
- **Maths**: o1 places among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME).

## Worse than most humans

- **Saying "I don't know"**. Virtually all Large Language Models have this problem of 'hallucination', making up information instead of saying it does not know. This might seem like a relatively minor shortcoming, but it's a very important one. It makes LLMs unreliable and strongly limits their applicability. However, studies [show](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.04307v1) that larger models hallucinate far less than smaller ones.
- **Being a convincing human**. GPT-4 can [convince](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08007) 54% of people that it's a human, but humans can do so 67% of the time. In other words, GPT-4 doesn't yet consistently pass the Turing test.
- **Dextrous movement**. No robots can move around like a human can, but we're getting closer. The [Atlas robot can walk, throw objects and do somersaults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e1_QhJ1EhQ). Google's [RT-2](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action) can turn objectives into actions in the real world, like "move the cup to the wine bottle". Tesla's Optimus robot can [fold clothes](https://electrek.co/2024/01/15/tesla-optimus-robot-cant-build-cars-folding-clothes/) and Figure's biped can [make coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5MKo7Idsok).
- **Self-replication**. All lifeforms on earth can replicate themselves. AI models could spread from computer to computer through the internet, but this requires a set of skills that AI models do not yet possess. A [2023 study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11671) lists a set of 12 tasks for self-replication, of which tested models completed 4. We don't want to find out [what happens](/xrisk) if an AI model succeeds in spreading itself across the web.
- **Continual learning**. Current SOTA LLMs separate learning ('training') from doing ('inference'). Although LLMs can learn using their _context_, they cannot update their weights while being used. Humans learn and do at the same time. However, there are multiple [potential approaches towards this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00487). A [2024 study](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01364v2) detailed some recent approaches for continual learning in LLMs.
- **Accomplishing goals** for which they were not trained and are not about outputting text, images or audio. If you ask an LLM with control over a computer or a robot, to do not-super-easy actions, or accomplish goals in virtual or real environments far from its training distribution, it will likely fail.
- **Planning**. LLMs are [not yet very good at planning (e.g. reasoning about how to stack blocks on a table)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YXogl4uQUO). However, larger models do perform way better than smaller ones.

## The endpoint

As time progresses and capabilities improve, we move items from lower sections to the top section.
When some specific [dangerous capabilities](/dangerous-capabilities) are achieved, AI will pose new risks.
At some point, AI will outcompete every human in every metric imaginable.
When we have built this superintelligence, [we will probably soon be dead](/ai-takeover).
Let's [implement a pause](/proposal) to make sure we don't get there.
