Over 60 UK politicians agree: Google DeepMind must address their violation of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments. Read more about Google's broken promises [here](https://pauseai.info/google-deepmind-broken-promises).

## Open Letter

Dear Sir Demis,

We write to express profound concern about Google DeepMind's failure to honour the Frontier AI Safety
Commitments signed at the AI Seoul Summit in 2024. The release of Gemini 2.5 Pro without the
transparency required by paragraph VIII of the commitments represents a troubling breach of trust with
governments and the public.
At the AI Seoul Summit, Google explicitly committed to:

- Conducting safety tests "before deploying" AI models with input from "independent third-party
  evaluators" as appropriate.
- Providing "public transparency" into testing processes.
- Disclosing "how, if at all, external actors, such as governments... are involved in the process".

Yet when you released Gemini 2.5 Pro on 25 March, no safety evaluation report accompanied it. A month
later, only a minimal "model card" appeared, lacking any substantive detail about external evaluations.
Even when directly questioned by journalists, Google refused to confirm whether government agencies
like the UK AI Security Institute participated in testing.

This is not a matter of semantics or technicalities. Labelling a publicly accessible model as "experimental"
does not absolve Google of its safety obligations. When anyone on the internet can use a frontier AI
system, it has been deployed in every meaningful sense.
You yourself have stated that AGI may arrive within five years. Leading AI researchers, such as Geoffrey
Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, estimate a 10% or greater chance that advanced AI could cause human
extinction. These are not distant hypotheticals but near-term possibilities requiring immediate, serious
action.

We are particularly troubled that Google, having helped establish these safety standards, would be among
the first to abandon them. This sets a dangerous precedent that undermines global efforts to develop AI
safely. If industry leaders treat safety commitments as optional when convenient, how can we expect
others to take them seriously?

**We therefore call on Google DeepMind to:**

1. **Establish clear definitions** of "deployment" that align with common understanding - when a model
   is publicly accessible, it is deployed.
2. **Publish a specific timeline** for when safety evaluation reports will be released for all future
   models.
3. **Clarify unambiguously,** for each model release, which government agencies and independent
   third-parties are involved in testing, and the exact timelines of their testing procedures.
   The development of artificial general intelligence may be humanity's most consequential undertaking. It
   demands the highest standards of responsibility, transparency, and caution. Google's technical capabilities
   come with commensurate obligations to society.
   We await your response and concrete actions to address these critical concerns.

Yours sincerely,
