**Implement a temporary pause on the development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4**.

This moratorium needs to be implemented on an international level, because we cannot expect countries or companies to risk their competitive advantage by pausing AI development on their own.

An international agreement is typically established through a summit, where leaders of countries meet to discuss the issue and make a decision.

We need our leaders to understand the urgency of the situation, and to take action **right now**:

- A country needs to step up and **host a summit**. Pick a date and and a location, then invite all UN member states.
- A **treaty** needs to be created. This treaty should specify what types of AI development are illegal, and which consequences there are to not abiding. This treaty needs to be signed by all UN member states.
