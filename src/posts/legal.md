### Policy Plan 2026 ("Beleidsplan")

It is our goal to prevent catastrophic risks from AI. We aim to achieve this by taking the following actions:

- Grow a community of volunteers to advocate for AI safety.
- Inform the public through social media, writing articles, participating in [interviews/podcasts](/press), and organizing events.
- Facilitate community growth by organizing social events.
- Distribute [donations](/donate) to projects that align with our goals.
- Organize [protests](/protests) and other forms of activism to raise awareness about the risks of AI.
- Educate [volunteers](/join) on how to become more effective advocates.
- Research policy measures and update [our proposal](/proposal) accordingly.

#### Financial accountability ("Financiële paragraaf")

We raise funds to support our activities through [donations](/donate), selling merchandise (through [the store](https://pauseai-shop.fourthwall.com/)) and applying for grants.

The funds will be used to cover the costs of our activities, such as hiring staff or freelancers (excluding the board), travel expenses, materials for events, marketing expenses, and other costs related to our mission.
We also expect to provide grants ("PauseAI MicroGrants") to volunteers who want to organize events, create content or otherwise contribute to our mission.

Our first bookkeeping year is longer than one year - it starts from our founding date (13-02-2024) and ends on 31-12-2025, after which we will publish an annual report within 6 months.

Received funds are managed by the board and are used to cover the costs of our activities. The foundation does not hold more capital than is reasonably necessary for the continuity of the planned activities. Any surplus is reserved solely to support future non-profit activities.

The board members do not receive any remuneration for their work.
They are entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred by them in the performance of their duties.

### Report of activities

A list of [media appearances](/press) and [organized protests](/protests) can be found on their respective pages.
