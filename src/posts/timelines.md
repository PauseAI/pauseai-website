How long do people expect it will take for AGI or superintelligent AI to be developed?

- **Metaculus 25% Weak AGI estimate**: [December 2025](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/)
- **David Shapiro**: [2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXQ6OKSvzfc)
- **Elon Musk** (X.ai, Tesla): [before 2026](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23980877/new-york-times-dealbook-summit-elon-musk-bob-iger-david-zaslav) ("discover new physics or invent new technology")
- **Jensen Huang**: [2028](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-agi-ai-five-years-2023-11?international=true&r=US&IR=T) (a computer that can complete tests which reflect basic intelligence that's "fairly competitive" to that of a normal human.)
- **Sam Altman** (CEO OpenAI): [could be reached sometime in the next four or five years](https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman/)
- **Yoshua Bengio** (Turing award winner): [2028 to 2043, 90% confidence interval](https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/08/12/personal-and-psychological-dimensions-of-ai-researchers-confronting-ai-catastrophic-risks/). Also asks himself: "And what if it was, indeed, just a few years? "
- **Geoffrey Hinton** (Turing award winner): [2028 to 2053](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1653687894534504451?lang=en) (he first thought it would take "at least" till 2070)
- **Gary Marcus** (Cognitiv): [not before 2026](https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1730003151971840419)

## Our take

Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.
Past expert AI predictions turned out to have been overly optimistic.

In some ways AI models are _already superhuman_, so we could be very close to models with [dangerous capabilities](/dangerous-capabilities).
Current [state of the art](/sota) AI models have an IQ of >130, speak 20 languages, write code in most programming languages, and can explain quantum mechanics in 18th-century German poetry.
Innovation is hard to predict, and important innovations could happen at any time.

**Since we're risking human extinction, we should err on the side of caution and [act as if AGI could be developed in the next few months](/urgency).**
