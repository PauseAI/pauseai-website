title: AI Risks and Pause Counterarguments

## AI is and will be really beneficial to the world

It could be. But it could also be [quite problematic](/risks). Both aspects have to be taken into account before developing a technology. And we could understand how to do that safely if we had more time.

## The biggest risks that you fear don't exist

Someone could believe this for various reasons, and some responses to those beliefs are [here](/ai-x-risk-skepticism).

At the end of the day, the important thing is to estimate how likely you think they are, compare it with [the ones from experts](/polls-and-surveys#catastrophic-risks-from-ai), and if you have estimations quite different from them, think about if you can justify that difference. Then, think if that probability of really terrible things happening for developing advanced AI is justified somehow in the present, or if we should do something about it.

## A Pause would be bad

Some ways in which a pause could be bad and how we could prevent those scenarios are explained on [this page](/mitigating-pause-failures). But if the article doesn't cover your worries you can tell us about them [here](https://airtable.com/appWPTGqZmUcs3NWu/pagIvo9Sv6IDHaolu/form).

## A Pause will never happen

Trying to predict the future accurately seems more difficult than getting a Pause, so you shouldn't be so sure about it. Our views on why we think it's possible are explained [here](/feasibility). And given how necessary it is, no matter how hard it could seem, we should try to achieve it anyway.

## I can't make a difference for myself and other arguments

At the heart of the problem, we think that most of the time there are not logical but emotional reasons that get in our way of taking action. In some cases, the arguments could be true, for sure. Like if you have more important things to take care of or better ways to mitigate the risks. But they are mostly excuses. [Some actions](/action) are low effort, have a lot of potential, and can be done by pretty much anyone.

You can read about mental obstacles that get in your way of accepting the risks and taking action [here](psychology-of-x-risk). With the help of the community, you can even have more impact and an environment that appreciates your valuable work and incentivizes you to keep going. On the bright side, the neglectedness of the problem also allows you to make a big difference at the start of this promising movement. There's plenty of low-hanging fruit to grab!
