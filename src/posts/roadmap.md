## Funding Scenarios

### Scenario 0: No additional funding

Almost every person working on PauseAI is doing so voluntarily, so our burn rate is very low.
We have around €90k in the bank.

- Hire an [**organizing director**](/2024-vacancy-organizing-director), who helps with growing our community and organizing volunteers. They will help us engage the community, organize events, build alliances/coalitions, raise funds, improve our onboarding pipeline and make volunteers more effective.
- Facilitate the formation of new National and Local groups. Provide them with help, guidance, materials and funding.
- Organize protests and other events to raise awareness about the issue and grow our community.
- Organize letter writing workshops to push the national-level politicians to initialize treaty negotiations.
- Build alliances with other organizations and overlapping cause areas to amplify our impact. E.g. artists, concerned parents, climate activists, job unions, etc.
- Grow our social media presence through regular posts and engagement.
- Participate in more [podcasts and interviews](/press).
- Create more video content (focused on shorts) to reach a wider audience.
- Get (paid) help from experts in various fields (marketing, policy, AI safety, community organizing, protesting, etc.) to learn from their experience and improve our work.
- Experiment with social media ads to grow our community and learn what works.
- Reach out to politicians and influencers.
- Spend our remaining budget on PauseAI community projects through our MicroGrants program.

### Scenario 1: €200k funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire a **social media director**. This will help us improve our presence on social media and reach more people. Getting more people to join our protests and community is an effective multiplier for our impact. They will help improve our [communication strategy](/communication-strategy).
- Hire a **video creator** who specializes in making audiovisual content. They can help us professionalize our videos and reach a wider audience.
- Hire a **web designer** to improve the look and feel of our website, specifically the Home page
- Set up an international pipeline for (video) content. Make it easier for national groups to consistently post high-quality, translated content to grow their impact.

### Scenario 2: €600k funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire a **campaign director** who will help us organize large scale campaigns and protests.
- Hire a **press director** who will help us get more media coverage. This person should have experience in PR and media relations.
- Hire a **policy director** who will help us strategize and execute our policy goals. This person should help us educate volunteers on how to lobby effectively and help us with our policy proposals. This person needs to have international legal expertise and preferably knowledge in AI or technology policy/governance.
- Drastically increased ads & MicroGrants budgets, leading to more growth and impactful community projects.

### Scenario 3: €1.2M+ funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Have more funding available for [national](https://pauseai.info/national-groups) and local PauseAI chapters. Find talented and motivated individuals who can lead these.
