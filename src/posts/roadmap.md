description: What are we planning to do and what could we do with more funding?
---

## Current situation

- See our [funding page](/funding) for up-to-date info on how much we've received and from whom.
- We have two paid FTEs: an Organizing Director and a Communications Director. All others are volunteers.

## Funding Scenarios

### Scenario 0: No additional funding

Almost every person working on PauseAI is doing so voluntarily, so our burn rate is very low.
We have around €90k in the bank.

- Facilitate the formation of new National and Local groups. Provide them with help, guidance, materials and funding.
- Organize protests and other events to raise awareness about the issue and grow our community.
- Organize letter writing workshops to push the national-level politicians to initialize treaty negotiations.
- Build alliances with other organizations and overlapping cause areas to amplify our impact. E.g. artists, concerned parents, climate activists, job unions, etc.
- Grow our social media presence through regular posts and engagement.
- Participate in more [podcasts and interviews](/press).
- Create more video content (focused on shorts) to reach a wider audience.
- Get (paid) help from experts in various fields (marketing, policy, AI safety, community organizing, protesting, etc.) to learn from their experience and improve our work.
- Experiment with social media ads to grow our community and learn what works.
- Reach out to politicians and influencers.
- Spend our remaining budget on PauseAI community projects through our MicroGrants program.

### Scenario 1: €200k funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire **National / Regional directors** for our most impactful areas (UK, France).
- Organize more [PauseCon](https://pausecon.org/) events to train our volunteers/organizers.
- Set up an international pipeline for (video) content. Make it easier for national groups to consistently post high-quality, translated content to grow their impact.
- Increase our spending on Ads on various social media platforms.
- Increase our MicroGrants budget, allowing us to fund more community projects.

### Scenario 2: €600k funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire a **policy director** who will help us strategize and execute our policy goals. This person should help us educate volunteers on how to lobby effectively and help us with our policy proposals. This person needs to have international legal expertise and preferably knowledge in AI or technology policy/governance.
- Hire a **press director** who will help us get more media coverage. This person should have experience in PR and media relations.
- Drastically increased ads & MicroGrants budgets, leading to more growth and impactful community projects.

### Scenario 3: €1.2M+ funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Have more funding available for [national](https://pauseai.info/national-groups) and local PauseAI chapters.
- Hire a PR agency to help us set up a large-scale international media campaign with a petition, advertisements.
