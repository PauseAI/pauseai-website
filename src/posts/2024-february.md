## Why we are protesting OpenAI

OpenAI is trying to build an AI smarter than humans.
Hundreds of scientists are warning that this could cause the end of humanity.
This is why over 33,000 people have signed the Pause letter, urging AI companies like OpenAI to halt their advancements.
Even Sam Altman himself, the CEO of OpenAI, has said that we should hit the brakes ["if AI models are improving in ways that we donâ€™t fully understand"](https://time.com/6288584/openai-sam-altman-full-interview/).
In a different interview, Sam mentioned that predicting capabilities is a ["fun guessing game"](https://www.ft.com/content/dd9ba2f6-f509-42f0-8e97-4271c7b84ded) for OpenAI employees.
In other words: even OpenAI does not understand how their models improve.
The time to hit the brakes is _now_.
