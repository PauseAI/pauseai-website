title: PauseAI MicroGrants
description: Our community fund to support projects that align with our mission.
---

We have a huge list of projects that our community is working on.
There's so much to do.
And sometimes we need funds to be more effective.
But getting funding can be a hassle - especially if you've never applied to a grant.

This is where PauseAI MicroGrants come in handy!
Small amounts of money (typically under 2000 EUR) for working on a project.
We're pretty open about what types of projects could apply, as long as they align with our mission of mitigating catastrophic risks from AI.

Here's a list of examples:

- **Organize an event** (location rental, food & drinks)
- **Make or promote videos** about why AI is dangerous or why we can pause it
- **Work on a policy draft**, e.g. formalise our [proposal](/proposal)
- **Perform market research**, e.g. a survey or message-testing study
- **Write for media**, e.g. write an opinion piece for a national newspaper
- **Set up a new organization** that aligns with our mission

## Limitations

- Do note that since we are a charity, we cannot provide a salary through this program.
- Your project and its benefits to society should stand on its own - it is not a project for the benefit of PauseAI.
- If you're planning on growing the PauseAI community by doing typical volunteer work, consider applying for a [volunteer stipend](/volunteer-stipends) instead.

## The process

- Describe your project in the `#ðŸ’ªprojects` channel on our Discord server. Tell about the idea, what you want to do, where you want help and what amount of money you need. Mention `@microgrants` to notify the microgrants team!
- Fill in the [MicroGrants Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oPXezImarCY7MCYaT-lJb-uLNbbQ76O1FYNr-WTS6hI/edit?usp=sharing) and send it to [joep@pauseai.info](mailto:joep@pauseai.info).
- We reach out to you. Either a) we give an OK right away, b) we want to see some changes/questions answered or c) give you a no.
- We'll send you a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that you need to sign.
- Get to work!
- Tell us when you're done, and we'll send you the grant. If you need the money upfront, we can discuss that option, but it should not be the default.
