title: PauseAI MicroGrants
description: Our community fund to support projects that align with our mission.
---

We have a huge list of projects that our community is working on.
There's so much to do.
And sometimes we need funds to be more effective.
But getting funding can be a hassle - especially if you've never applied to a grant.

This is where PauseAI MicroGrants come in handy!
Small amounts of money (typically under 2000 EUR) for working on a project.
We're pretty open about what types of projects could apply, as long as they align with our mission of mitigating catastrophic risks from AI.

Here's a list of examples:

- **Organize an event** (location rental, food & drinks)
- **Make or promote videos** about why AI is dangerous or why we can pause it
- **Work on a policy draft**, e.g. formalise our [proposal](/proposal)
- **Perform market research**, e.g. a survey or message-testing study
- **Write for media**, e.g. write an opinion piece for a national newspaper
- **Set up a new organization** that aligns with our mission

## Criteria and rules

1. Purpose and scope
   1. Microgrants are one-off individual grants made from PauseAI Global’s budget.
   2. They are used to cover the cost of resources and project investments.
   3. They do not cover volunteer time or salaries. Our [volunteer stipend](/volunteer-stipends) system exists for this purpose.
   4. Projects seeking microgrants must directly relate to PauseAI Global [Mission](/proposal), [Strategy](/theory-of-change) and Activities.
2. Eligibility requirements
   1. Applicants must have joined PauseAI via the official Global [webform](/join) and signed the volunteer agreement, before applying.
   2. Preference will be given to volunteers with a demonstrated history of PauseAI contributions.
   3. Applicants who have previously received a microgrant cannot receive a second microgrant if the deliverables of the previous were not completed and reported.
   4. Chapter applications will require a signed Memorandum of Understanding.
3. Process and Timeline
   1. The form must be completed.
   2. Payment timing:
      1. Preferred - reimbursement following receiving the final completion form (and receipts).
      2. Advance payment is possible but requires greater notice.
   3. Leadership team may reach out for a call if application lacks clarity.
   4. Organizing Director and CEO (with leadership team consultation) make final decisions on allocation.
4. Strategic allocation
   1. Typically microgrants should be under 2000 EUR.
   2. Decisions made by leadership should align with the overall strategy and therefore funds may not be divided equitably across chapters.
   3. Decisions will always be made subject to available funds and organizational priorities.
5. Accountability
   1. Within one month of project completion, the successful recipient must submit receipts and reporting.
   2. Failure to comply will affect eligibility for future microgrants.
