title: PauseAI MicroGrants
description: Our community fund to support projects that align with our mission.
---

We have a huge list of projects that our community is working on. There's so much to do. And sometimes we need funds to be more effective.

But getting funding can be a hassle — especially if you've never applied for a grant.

This is where PauseAI MicroGrants come in handy! Small grants (typically under €2,000) to fund a specific project that advances our mission of mitigating catastrophic risks from AI.

Here are some examples of projects we might fund:

- **Organize an event** (venue rental, food & drinks, materials)
- **Produce or promote videos** about AI risks or the case for pausing
- **Develop a policy draft**, e.g. formalizing our [proposal](/proposal)
- **Conduct research**, e.g. a survey or message-testing study
- **Write for media**, e.g. an opinion piece for a national newspaper
- **Set up a new organization** that aligns with our mission

## Criteria and Rules

### Purpose and Scope

- MicroGrants are one-off grants from PauseAI Global's budget to fund **specific projects with defined deliverables and a clear end date.**
- They are not intended to compensate ongoing regular work for PauseAI. If you are looking for support for sustained volunteering, see our [Volunteer Stipend](/volunteer-stipends) program. If your proposal is effectively ongoing work rather than a bounded project, we may discuss a contractor arrangement instead.
- Projects must directly relate to PauseAI Global's [mission](/proposal), [strategy](/theory-of-change), and activities.

### Eligibility Requirements

- Applicants must have joined PauseAI via the official [Global webform](/join) and signed the volunteer agreement before applying.
- Preference is given to volunteers with a demonstrated history of contributions to PauseAI.
- Applicants who have previously received a microgrant cannot receive a second one if the deliverables of the first were not completed and reported.
- Chapter applications require a signed Memorandum of Understanding.

### Application Process

1. Complete the application form below.
2. The Organizing Director and CEO make final decisions on allocation. Someone may reach out for a call if the application needs clarification.
3. Applicants will be informed of the decision within one month.
4. **If approved, the recipient must sign a Grant Letter before any funds are disbursed.** The Grant Letter documents the grant's purpose, amount, expected deliverables, and timeline.

### Payment

- Payment is typically made as an advance after the Grant Letter is signed.
- In some cases, reimbursement after project completion (with receipts) may be preferred.
- The method will be agreed in the Grant Letter.

### Strategic Allocation

- Grants are typically under €2,000.
- Allocation decisions are made in alignment with PauseAI Global's overall strategy and are subject to available funds and organizational priorities.
- Funds may not be distributed evenly across regions or chapters.

### Tax Responsibility

**Grant recipients are solely responsible for understanding and meeting any tax obligations** that may apply to the grant in their country of residence. The Grant Letter will include an acknowledgment of this responsibility. PauseAI cannot provide tax advice.

### Accountability and Reporting

- Within one month of project completion, the recipient must submit a brief completion report and any relevant receipts.
- Failure to comply will affect eligibility for future microgrants.
