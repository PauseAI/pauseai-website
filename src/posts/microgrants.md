title: PauseAI MicroGrants
description: Our community fund to support projects that align with our mission.
---

We have a huge list of projects that our community is working on.
There's so much to do.
And sometimes we need funds to be more effective.
But getting funding can be a hassle - especially if you've never applied to a grant.

This is where PauseAI MicroGrants come in handy!
Small amounts of money (typically under 2000 EUR) for working on a project.
We're pretty open about what types of projects could apply.
Here's a list of examples:

- **Organize an event**, like an email lobby session (fee for organising, location rental, food & drinks)
- **Make videos** about why we need to Pause AI
- **Help out with the website**, e.g. writing articles, making technical improvements
- **Do research**, e.g. for the #"AI Safety Scorecard".
- **Work on a policy draft**, e.g. formalise our [proposal](/proposal)
- **Perform market research**, e.g. a survey or message-testing study
- **Write for media**, e.g. write an opinion piece for a national newspaper

## The process

- Describe your project in the `#ðŸ’ªprojects` channel on our Discord server. Tell about the idea, what you want to do, where you want help and what amount of money you need. Mention `@microgrants` to notify the microgrants team!
- Fill in the [MicroGrants Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oPXezImarCY7MCYaT-lJb-uLNbbQ76O1FYNr-WTS6hI/edit?usp=sharing) and send it to [joep@pauseai.info](mailto:joep@pauseai.info).
- We reach out to you. Either a) we give an OK right away, b) we want to see some changes/questions answered or c) give you a no.
- We'll send you a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that you need to sign.
- Get to work!
- Tell us when you're done, and we'll send you the grant. If you need the money upfront, we can discuss that option, but it should not be the default.

## Who will fund

- PauseAI will fund 10,000 EUR
- Greg Colbourn will fund an additional 10,000 EUR
