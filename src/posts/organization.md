Welcome to PauseAI!

## Organization structure

- [Legal entities](/legal): PauseAI consists of one international entity, and several local / national legal entities. This website and the social media accounts are managed by the international entity. National entities can have their own website and their own way of doing things.
- [People (Volunteers)](/people): List of registered volunteers who have opted to show their profile and have committed to work on PauseAI for at least some hours a week.
- [Teams](/teams): Our volunteers work in all sorts of teams. Every team has its own leader, Discord channel, Drive folder and of course list of members. Reach out to a team leader to join a team!
- [National groups](/national-groups): National PauseAI groups are hubs that typically manage their own local communities, and are responsible for national-level strategy and coordination. They typically have their own website, social media accounts and legal entity.
- [Local communities](/communities): Check if there already exists a community in your area. Most groups are communicating in our discord server, in the `#local-meetups` channel (If you want to create a new local group, post there!). Some groups are using tools like WhatsApp or a separate Discord server.
