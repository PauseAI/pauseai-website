## How We're Structured

PauseAI is a federation of local chapters coordinated by a global entity (PauseAI Global). This website and the main social media accounts are managed by PauseAI Global.

### Leadership

**Executive Team** — The decision-making body for PauseAI Global, composed of paid leadership staff. The Executive Team sets strategy, allocates resources, and coordinates the federation.

- **CEO** — Maxime Fournes. Owns organizational strategy, governance, major external relationships, budget, and global operations.
- **Organizing Director** — Irina Tavera. Owns volunteer growth systems, chapter support, campaign execution, and manages National Directors.
- **Communications Director** — Jonathan Moody. Owns communication strategy, narrative and messaging, media relations, and content production.

**Board** — Provides governance oversight: strategy approval, annual budget, and major structural changes. The Board does not intervene in day-to-day operations.

### Chapters

PauseAI chapters are local organizations — national, regional, or city-based — that adapt global strategy to their context and run on-the-ground campaigns. Most chapters today are national.

**Chapter Directors** are paid by PauseAI Global and manage chapters of high strategic importance. **Chapter Leads** are volunteers or are employed by their local chapter. All Chapter Directors and Leads coordinate through monthly meetings and regular check-ins with the Organizing Director.

Chapters typically have their own community, and may have their own website, social media accounts, and legal entity. Check the [communities page](/communities) to find a chapter near you.

### Volunteers

Volunteers are the heart of the movement. At PauseAI Global, volunteers contribute through operational teams:

| Team | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Operations Team** | Internal systems, website, tools, technical infrastructure |
| **Onboarding Team** | Welcoming new volunteers and getting them active |
| **Comms Team** | Content support, social media, newsletter |

Each team is owned by a member of the paid staff, and may be led day-to-day by a dedicated volunteer.

If you want to get involved locally — protests, meetups, lobbying — that happens through your [local chapter](/communities).

### Advisory Council

The Advisory Council is a group of experienced, high-contribution volunteers who advise the Executive Team on strategy and raise issues from across the movement. It meets monthly, is invite-based, and operates on a "disagree and commit" principle: members can debate and challenge ideas, but once the Executive Team makes a decision, it is respected.

## How We Work

**Decision documentation:** We follow a principle of "if it's not written down, it doesn't exist." Significant decisions are recorded with what was decided, who decided, when, and why.

**Communication:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA) is our community space for discussion and coordination. Decisions and documentation live in our internal knowledge management system (Notion).

**Campaigns:** PauseAI runs coordinated campaigns across the federation. Campaign themes are set by the Executive Team in consultation with Chapter Directors and Leads. Chapters adapt campaigns to their local context.
