Please read the PauseAI Protestors' Code of Conduct [here](https://pauseai.info/protesters-code-of-conduct) before attending this protest.

What:

- Lawful protest outside Google DeepMind + awareness-raising/recruitment outside EAG London

When & where:

- 1200-1400 Fri 19 May outside Google DeepMind
- 1200-1400 Sat 20 and Sun 21 May outside EAG London
- 1700-2000 Mon 22 May outside Google DeepMind
- In the future: regular (weekly?) protest?

Exact locations:

- Google DeepMind in building [S2 Handyside](https://www.kingscross.co.uk/s2-handyside): [2 Canal Reach](https://goo.gl/maps/HEA1pvEQJRfmymiEA?coh=178571&entry=tt), King's Cross, London, N1C 4DC
- Effective Altruism Global London ([EAG London](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-global/events/ea-global-london-2023)): [Tobacco Dock](https://goo.gl/maps/MfVJ6Exfv7B1NbcL6?coh=178571&entry=tt), Tobacco Quay, Wapping Lane, Wapping, London, E1W 2SF

Why:

- To call for a moratorium on AGI development
- To raise public awareness of the threat posed by AGI development
- To create and leverage social pressure on Google DeepMind and other AI companies
- To build momentum for a social movement calling for better AI safety, governance and ethics in general
- In particular, to set a precedent for a regular (weekly?) protest

How:

- We will lawfully and peacefully stand outside Google DeepMind with placards and a banner, possibly handing out flyers / stickers / pin badges to DeepMind employees and passers-by
- We will have respectful, cooperative conversations
- We may give speeches (more likely) and/or sing and/or chant (less likely)
- We may dress up in attention-grabbing costumes
- Our tone will be informative, inclusive and even humorous rather than confrontational and disruptive
- We aim to get up to 30 people to this first protest

Legal:

- This is a wholly lawful, legal and non-arrestable protest
- We will stand on the pavement (public space), not on private land

Press/media/publicity:

- Alistair will write a press release and share with newspapers etc.
- Alistair will post on the EA Forum, Alignment Forum and LessWrong
- Please share as far as you can on social media, by word of mouth etc.!

## Messaging & narrative

The problem:

- We don't know how AI works
- We haven't solved alignment
- Solve alignment first
- How do we control an artificial superintelligence?
- AI safety, then AI development
- AI poses an existential threat to humanity
- 30% chance of bad outcomes from ASI -- [AI safety researchers](https://pauseai.info/xrisk)
- Risk of blowing up the planet is more than 1% -- [AI researchers](https://twitter.com/liron/status/1656929936639430657?s=20)
- Experts are worried
- See PauseAI's expert quotes [here](https://pauseai.info/xrisk)
- Pause the race to the bottom
- What if we can't pull the plug?
- We killed off the Neanderthals; will AI kill us off?
- AI wiping out humanity is "not inconceivable" -- Hinton
- This will change everything
- #dontlookup
- Don't let AI decide our future
- What if AI goes rogue?

The solution:

- Pause AI
- #pauseAI
- #justlookup
- Don't build AGI
- Stop building AGI
- Moratorium on AGI development, now
- Global AI summit, now
- Global AI treaty, now
- Global AI referendum, now [more controversial]

The end result:

- Safe, secure, aligned AI
- AI summer
- We don't need AGI for an amazing future
