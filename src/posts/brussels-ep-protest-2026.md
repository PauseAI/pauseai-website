### Why We're Protesting

The race to build ever-more powerful AI systems is accelerating without adequate safeguards. Leading AI scientists - including Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Stuart Russell - have warned that frontier AI development poses catastrophic and potentially existential risks to humanity. Despite these warnings, no binding international framework exists to govern or limit this development.

We are calling on the European Union to lead the way by:

1. **Initiating negotiations for a global treaty** to pause the development of frontier AI systems beyond the current state of the art, conditional on demonstrable progress in AI safety and alignment research.
2. **Establishing robust international oversight mechanisms** - including compute monitoring, mandatory safety evaluations, and enforceable red lines - before further scaling proceeds.
3. **Championing democratic governance of AI** - ensuring that decisions about technologies that affect all of humanity are not left to a handful of corporations and governments racing for strategic advantage.

The EU has already shown leadership with the AI Act. Now it must go further. A pause is not anti-technology - it is the responsible path to ensuring that advanced AI serves humanity rather than threatening it.

### What to Expect

- **Speeches** from PauseAI leaders and international organizers, including speakers from the earlier European Parliament conference
- **A striking visual centrepiece** - a large black box symbolizing the opaque and uncontrollable nature of frontier AI systems
- **Signs and placards** - many made by PauseCon attendees during the weekend's sign-making workshop
- **A chance to sign the PauseAI statement** calling for a global pause on frontier AI development - join thousands of concerned citizens adding their voice

This is a **peaceful, lawful, and authorized** demonstration. Police authorization has been secured. Please read our [Code of Conduct](/protesters-code-of-conduct) before attending.

### Context: PauseCon Brussels 2026

This protest caps off an extraordinary weekend. PauseCon Brussels (Feb 21-23) brings together volunteers and organizers from PauseAI chapters across Europe and beyond for:

- **Training workshops** on campaign strategy, communications, and community organizing
- **A keynote from Professor Stuart Russell**, world-renowned AI researcher and author of _Human Compatible_
- **A conference inside the European Parliament** on Monday morning, with confirmed participation from Members of the European Parliament

The demonstration immediately follows the Parliament conference, carrying the energy and the message from inside the institution to the public square outside it.
