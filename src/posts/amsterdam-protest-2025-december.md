On December 13, 2025, we held a protest in Amsterdam to urge both the Dutch government and the Netherlands-based company ASML to stop supplying to companies developing artificial superintelligence.

## **Why the Netherlands? Why ASML? Why Now?**

ASML manufactures the only extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines capable of producing cutting-edge AI chips. Without ASML's technology, there is no quick path to superintelligence. No other company can currently replicate what ASML does.

ASML already restricts access for national security, blocking exports to China and Russia. They have even installed remote shutdown capabilities in their machines.

### **PauseAI’s Demand to the Dutch Government and ASML:**

Require ASML to supply only customers who:

- Commit to the superintelligence moratorium through binding agreements
- Submit to verification by an independent regulatory commission
- Require the same from their business customers

This preserves beneficial AI including medical research, climate modeling, scientific discovery while preventing the reckless race toward uncontrolled superintelligence.
