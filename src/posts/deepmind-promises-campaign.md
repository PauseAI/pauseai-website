Google DeepMind have violated the promises they made to the UK government by signing on to the Frontier AI Safety Commitments in 2024. We held the biggest AI safety protest of all time outside their London offices, and will be releasing an open letter with sitting politicians to demand Google stick to their promises.

The Frontier AI Safety Commitments were signed by most major AI companies. Amongst other commitments, signatories committed to "assess the risks posed by their frontier models [...] before deploying that model", to consider results from external safety tests, and to "explain how, if at all, external actors, such as governments [...] are involved in the process of assessing the risks of their AI models."

With their release of Gemini 2.5 Pro in March 2025, they failed to publish any safety report, and only released one three weeks later. However, at no point have Google given any details about which external bodies have been involved in risk assessment, or how they've been involved.

Read the full details about Google's violation of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments [here](/google-deepmind-broken-promises).

In response, PauseAI has taken the following actions:

- [Held the largest AI safety protest of all time](/deepmind-protest-2025) outside Google DeepMind's London offices.
- Dozens of sitting UK politicians have signed our open letter calling on Google to establish clear definitions of "deployment", publish specific timelines for the publication of safety reports, and to clarify unambiguously which third parties are involved in testing their models.
