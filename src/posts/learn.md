## If you are convinced and want to take action

There are many [things that you can do](/action).
Writing a letter, going to a protest, donating some money or joining a community is not that hard!
And these actions have a real impact.
Even when facing the end of the world, there can still be hope and very rewarding work to do.

## Or if you still don't feel quite sure of it

Learning about the [psychology of x-risk](/psychology-of-x-risk) could help you.
