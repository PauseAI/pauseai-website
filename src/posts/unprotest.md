## Show support for AI safety action, and help save the world from AI's [many risks](https://airisk.mit.edu/)! We have an urgent need for people to help us with any of the following:

(Updated Sept 18)

**If you’re reading this (five minute tasks anyone can do):**
- Send an email about AI’s risks to [all your US elected officials simultaneously](https://democracy.io/), to [the UN AI advisory body](mailto:aiadvisorybody@un.org), and to [the US representative at the UN.](https://usun.usmission.gov/mission/contact-us/). If you don’t know what to say, use [our email builder](https://pauseai.info/email-builder).
- Join [our in-person monthly meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957) each month on the 11th.
- Join our online NYC community in the following locations: [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1223374237016784928), [Whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KAQMwz2nQeWIkTLxwKxHg1) We mostly use Discord for now, but let us know if you want alternative communication.
- Follow PauseAINYC on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pauseainyc/), or on [Twitter](https://x.com/PauseAINYC).

**If you like to socialize:**
- Sign up for one of [our events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/pause-ai-nyc-83065324363). We do everything from public demonstrations in front of AI companies to attending networking sessions with related organizations.
- Set up a meeting with [your local political official](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) to discuss AI risks. [Copy us by email](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) so we can support your engagement with resources and additional members. Alternatively, finding an official in your state or region who works directly on AI legislation may be more productive.

**If you’re good at posting and networking on social media:**
- [Attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957), or send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience. We’re specifically looking for people who can connect with other technology risk communities and expand our reach as an organization on social media.
- For less of a commitment, showing appreciation for the PauseAINYC posts through likes, supportive comments, and follows is also appreciated

**If you’re good at web development:**
- [Attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957), or send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience. We're looking for people to write and potentially help host our own separate website (that doesn't cost a million dollars from a web host provider).

**If you’re good at photography, videography, and/or media production:**
- We're always looking for more people to help us capture our public demonstrations and spread the message. Either [attend our in-person meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pauseai-monthly-action-meeting-tickets-914711244957), or send an email to [nyc@pauseai.info](mailto:nyc@pauseai.info) with a brief summary of your experience.

**If you want to provide financial support:**
- You can [donate here](https://pauseai.info/donate). Your donations are tax-deductible (if you itemize your taxes), and all donations go directly to people and projects addressing the dangers of AI.
- Alternatively, you can directly fund specific projects, such as t-shirt printing costs or funds to help members travel to protest together. Information about this is available on [the Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1100491867675709580/1223374237016784928).
