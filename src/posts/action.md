AI won't get safer unless we act decisively to push for safety.
Choose an activity below depending on your interests or skills.

## Demand government action

- **Write to your politicians**: We've found emails are surprisingly effective and take relatively little effort. If you don't feel confident about what to write, [start with our email builder](/email-builder). When you get a meeting, you should check out our [lobby tips](/lobby-tips).
- **Call your politicians**: Try calling legislators' offices while having a set of talking points in view so you stay on topic.
- **Protest**: Join [one of the protests](https://pauseai.info/protests) or [organize one yourself](https://pauseai.info/organizing-a-protest).
- **Sign petitions**: [**Ours**](/statement), [Statement on Superintelligence](https://superintelligence-statement.org/), [International AI Treaty](https://aitreaty.org), [Demand responsible AI](https://www.change.org/p/artificial-intelligence-time-is-running-out-for-responsible-ai-development-91f0a02c-130a-46e1-9e55-70d6b274f4df).

## Inform people around you

- **Share about AI risk** on your social media. One of [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBqU1QxCao8&list=PLI46NoubGtIJa0JVCBR-9CayxCOmU0EJt) or this website can be a good start. And don't forget to tag us in your posts.
- **Talk to people in your life** about AI safety. Answer their questions, and encourage them to act too. Use our [counterarguments](/counterarguments) to help you be more persuasive.
- **[Tabling](/tabling) and [flyering](/flyering)** are great ways to reach many people in a short amount of time.
- **Attend local events**: Many cities have (free / low-cost) events about AI & technology policy. Attending these events is a great way to network and share your concerns.

## Support PauseAI

- **Join or create a [local PauseAI community](/communities)**.
- **Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/T3YrWUJsJ5)**, where most of the collaboration happens.
- **Protest or participate in [events](/communities#events)**. If no protest is near you, consider [starting one](/organizing-a-protest).
- **Look over our [vacancies](/vacancies)** to see if any of your skills match our organizational needs. We're often looking for people with experience in social media, communications, organizing, outreach, and software. Some positions are compensated.

- **[Donate](/donate)** to PauseAI or buy some merchandise in our [store](https://pauseai-shop.fourthwall.com/).
