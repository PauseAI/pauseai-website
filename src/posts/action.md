## For everyone

### Demand government action

- **Call your politicians**: Try calling legislators' offices while having a set of talking points in view so you stay on topic.

- **Sign petitions**: [International AI Treaty](https://aitreaty.org), [Ban Superintelligence](https://chng.it/Djjfj2Gmpk), [Demand responsible AI](https://www.change.org/p/artificial-intelligence-time-is-running-out-for-responsible-ai-development-91f0a02c-130a-46e1-9e55-70d6b274f4df), or one of the **national petitions**: [UK](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/639956), [AUS](https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN5163), [NL](https://aipetitie.nl).

## For specific people

### If you work in AI

- **Don't work towards better AI**: Do not work for AI companies or capabilities research. And do not spread ideas on how we can make AI systems faster or smarter.
- **Talk to your management and colleagues** about the risks. Get them to take an institutional position toward mitigating risk over profit. Encourage implementation of standard risk mitigation procedures and anonymous reporting.
- **Hold a seminar** on AI safety at your workplace. Check out these [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1p9VtopzMV6Xpk4p6EGYUTna4fLE6G8hd) and [talks and videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI46NoubGtIJa0JVCBR-9CayxCOmU0EJt) for inspiration.
- **Sign** the [Statement on AI Risk](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk).

### If you are a politician or work in government

- **Prepare for the next [AI safety summit](/summit)**. Form coalitions with other countries to share safety information and act quickly when harms arise. Work towards a global treaty.
- **Invite (or subpoena) AI lab leaders** to parliamentary/congressional hearings to give their predictions and timelines of AI disasters.
- **Establish a committee** to investigate the [risks of AI](/risks). Publish the findings, if feasible.
