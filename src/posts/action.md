The group of people who are aware of AI risks is still small.

You are now one of them.

**Your actions matter more than you think.**

Here are some examples of what you can do.

## Tell your friends

- **Talk** to people in your life about this. Answer their questions, and get them to act. Use our [counterarguments](/counterarguments) to help you be more persuasive.
- [**Flyers**](/flyering) print, share and post flyers.
  - Having some printed one-page flyers on hand, or easily available to show and share from your phone, can be a quick and useful resource for faqs, talking points, expert quotes and opinions, online resources, etc.
- **Share** about AI risk on social media. This website might be a good start.
- **Create** [articles](/learn#articles), [videos](/learn#videos) or [memes](https://twitter.com/AISafetyMemes). Collaborate with others in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA) (in the #projects channel).

## Tell your politicians

- [**Send an email to a politician**](/email-builder): emails are completely overpowered. Do it.
- [**Lobby**](/lobby-tips): convince your government to work towards a pause and prepare for the [summit](/summit).
- [**Protest**](/protests): join [one of the protests](/protests) or [organize one yourself](/organizing-a-protest).
- **Sign petitions**:
  - [International AI Treaty](https://aitreaty.org)
  - [Ban Superintelligence](https://chng.it/Djjfj2Gmpk)
  - [Demand responsible AI](https://www.change.org/p/artificial-intelligence-time-is-running-out-for-responsible-ai-development-91f0a02c-130a-46e1-9e55-70d6b274f4df)
  - Or one of the **national petitions**: [UK](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/639956), [AUS](https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN5163), [NL](https://aipetitie.nl)

## If you...

### If you are a politician or work in government

- **Prepare for the next [AI safety summit](/summit)**. Form coalitions with other countries. Work towards a global treaty.
- **Invite (or subpoena) AI lab leaders** to parliamentary/congressional hearings to give their predictions and timelines of AI disasters.
- **Establish a committee** to investigate the [risks of AI](/risks).
- **Make AI safety a priority** in your party's platform, your government's policy, or just make sure it's on the agenda.

### If you know (international) law

- **Help draft policy**. [Draft examples](https://www.campaignforaisafety.org/celebrating-the-winners-law-student-moratorium-treaty-competition/). ([some](https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FLI_Policymaking_In_The_Pause.pdf) [frameworks](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/))
- **Make submissions to government requests for comment** on AI policy ([example](https://ntia.gov/issues/artificial-intelligence/request-for-comments)).

### If you work in AI

- **Don't work towards superintelligence**. If you have some cool idea on how we can make AI systems 10x faster, please don't build it / spread it / talk about it. We need to slow down AI development, not speed it up.
- **Talk to your management and colleagues** about the risks. Get them to take an institutional position on this.
- **Hold a seminar** on AI safety at your workplace. Check out the [videos](/learn#videos) for inspiration.
- **Sign** the [Statement on AI Risk](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk).
