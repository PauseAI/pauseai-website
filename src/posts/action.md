AI won't get safer unless we act decisively to push for safety. Choose an activity below from your interest / skill areas, or propose your own - your actions will decide the course of humanity's future.

## For everyone

### 1. Demand government action

- **Write an email to your politicians** - we've found emails are surprisingly effective and take relatively little effort. Try to convince your government to work towards a pause or enforce other binding AI safety legislation. If you don't know what to write, [start with our email builder](/email-builder). When you get a meeting, you may want to use the following [lobby tips](/lobby-tips). (If you're in the US, [Democracy.io](https://democracy.io) makes it easier to send emails to all your federal representatives.)
- **Call your politicians** - If you're okay talking on the phone, try calling legislators' offices. You may want to have a set of talking points in view so you stay on topic.
- **Show up to politicians' offices** - Many legislators have offices where members of the public can visit. The most effective.
- **Join / Organize a Demonstration**: Joining an in-person gathering, even a small group, magnifies your impact. See part 3 for more information on joining / organizing protests with PauseAI.
- **Sign petitions**: [International AI Treaty](https://aitreaty.org), [Ban Superintelligence](https://chng.it/Djjfj2Gmpk), [Demand responsible AI](https://www.change.org/p/artificial-intelligence-time-is-running-out-for-responsible-ai-development-91f0a02c-130a-46e1-9e55-70d6b274f4df), or one of the **national petitions**: [UK](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/639956), [AUS](https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN5163), [NL](https://aipetitie.nl).

### 2. Inform people around you

- **Share about AI risk** on your social media. Tag @pauseai (Twitter), @pause_ai (Instagram) in your posts. If you want to use our social media posts, send us a message on social media or [the Discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA).
- **Talk to people in your life** about AI safety. Answer their questions, and encourage them to act too. Use our [counterarguments](/counterarguments) to help you be more persuasive.
- **Meet with local groups** - many cities have (free / low-cost) events about AI & technology policy. Attending these events is a great way to network and share your concerns. If you want AI safety marketing materials, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA) so we can send you some.

### 3. Join / support PauseAI

- **Join the **[**Discord**](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA)**, where most of the collaboration happens.**
- **Find or create a **[**local PauseAI community**](/communities).
- **Participate in a protest**, either on your own or with your local group. Find these on [event](/events). If no protest is near you, consider [starting one](/organizing-a-protest).
- **Look over our **[**vacancies list**](/vacancies) to see if any of your skills match our organizational needs. We're often looking for people with experience in social media, communications, organizing, outreach, and software. Some positions are compensated.

## For specific people

### If you work in AI

- **DON'T WORK TOWARD STRONGER OR FASTER AI!** If you have some cool idea on how we can make AI systems 10x faster, please don't build it / spread it / talk about it. We need to slow down AI development, not speed it up.
- **Talk to your management and colleagues** about the risks. Get them to take an institutional position toward mitigating risk over profit. Encourage implementation of standard risk mitigation procedures and anonymous reporting.
- **Hold a seminar** on AI safety at your workplace. Check out these [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1p9VtopzMV6Xpk4p6EGYUTna4fLE6G8hd) and [talks and videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI46NoubGtIJa0JVCBR-9CayxCOmU0EJt) for inspiration.
- **Sign** the [Statement on AI Risk](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk).
- **Reach out** by email or on Signal (pauseainyc.11) if you have anything critical to share.

### If you are a politician or work in government

- **Prepare for the next [AI safety summit](/summit)**. Form coalitions with other countries to share safety information and act quickly when harms arise. Work towards a global treaty.
- **Invite (or subpoena) AI lab leaders** to parliamentary/congressional hearings to give their predictions and timelines of AI disasters.
- **Establish a committee** to investigate the [risks of AI](/risks). Publish the findings, if feasible.
- **Push for government discussions about the [risks of AI](/risks) AI safety within and outside of your party.
- **Work with opposition politicians** to demonstrate that AI safety affects us all, regardless of political beliefs.

### If you have experience with (international) law

- **Help draft policy**. [Draft examples](https://www.campaignforaisafety.org/celebrating-the-winners-law-student-moratorium-treaty-competition/). ([some](https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FLI_Policymaking_In_The_Pause.pdf) [frameworks](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/))
- **Make submissions to government requests for comment** on AI policy ([example](https://ntia.gov/issues/artificial-intelligence/request-for-comments)).

### If you work as a journalist or have a social media following

- **Create content about the risks of AI to society, or cover one of our events.** For more information, reach out to us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA), by Signal (pauseainyc.11), or any of our other communication channels.
