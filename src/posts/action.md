AI will won't get safer unless we act decisively to push for safety. Choose an activity below from your interest / skill areas and help save the future!

## For everyone

### 1. Encourage governments to act

- [**Create an email for a politician**](/email-builder) **in the** [**US**](https://democracy.io/): Emails are completely overpowered. Try to convince your government to work towards a pause or enforce other binding AI safety legislation. Here are some [**lobby tips**](/lobby-tips).
- **Sign petitions**: [International AI Treaty](https://aitreaty.org), [Ban Superintelligence](https://chng.it/Djjfj2Gmpk), [Demand responsible AI](https://www.change.org/p/artificial-intelligence-time-is-running-out-for-responsible-ai-development-91f0a02c-130a-46e1-9e55-70d6b274f4df), or one of the **national petitions**: [UK](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/639956), [AUS](https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN5163), [NL](https://aipetitie.nl)

### 2. Inform others

- **Share** about AI risk on your social media. Tag @pauseai (Twitter), or @pause_ai (Instagram) in your posts.
- **Talk** to people in your life about AI safety. Answer their questions, and encourage them to act too. Use our [counterarguments](/counterarguments) to help you be more persuasive.

## For specific people

### If you work in AI

- **DON'T WORK TOWARD STRONGER OR FASTER AI!** If you have some cool idea on how we can make AI systems 10x faster, please don't build it / spread it / talk about it. We need to slow down AI development, not speed it up.
- **Talk to your management and colleagues** about the risks. Get them to take an institutional position toward mitigating risk over profit. Encourage implementation of standard risk mitigation procedures and anonymous reporting.
- **Hold a seminar** on AI safety at your workplace. Check out these [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1p9VtopzMV6Xpk4p6EGYUTna4fLE6G8hd) and [talks and videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI46NoubGtIJa0JVCBR-9CayxCOmU0EJt) for inspiration.
- **Sign** the [Statement on AI Risk](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk).
- **Reach out** by email or [on Signal](https://signal.org/) if you have anything critical to share - username: pauseainyc.11

### If you are a politician or work in government

- **Prepare for the next [AI safety summit](/summit)**. Form coalitions with other countries. Work towards a global treaty.
- **Invite (or subpoena) AI lab leaders** to parliamentary/congressional hearings to give their predictions and timelines of AI disasters.
- **Establish a committee** to investigate the [risks of AI](/risks).
- **Work with opposition politicians** to demonstrate that AI safety affects us all, regardless of political beliefs.

### If you have experience with (international) law

([some](https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FLI_Policymaking_In_The_Pause.pdf) [frameworks](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/))
