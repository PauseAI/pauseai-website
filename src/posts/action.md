The group of people who are aware of AI risks is still small.

You are now one of them.

**Your actions matter more than you think.**

## You can do this

- **[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA)** or [other](https://coda.io/@alignmentdev/alignmentecosystemdevelopment) AI safety communities.
- **[Learn](/learn)** more about AI alignment and the risks we are facing.
- **Sign petitions**: [pause giant AI experiments](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/), [demand responsible AI](https://www.change.org/p/artificial-intelligence-time-is-running-out-for-responsible-ai-development-91f0a02c-130a-46e1-9e55-70d6b274f4df).
- **Talk** to people in your life about this. Answer their questions, get them to act.
- **Share** about AI on social media. This website might be a good start.
- **Create** [articles](/learn#articles), [videos](/learn#videos) or [memes](https://twitter.com/AISafetyMemes)
- **Protest**. Even if it's just you with a sign.
- **Lobby** politicians/industry. Talk to any relevant contacts you might have, the higher up, the better.

## If you ...

### If you are convincing

- **Convince journalists** to write about AI safety. Point them to [educational materials](/learn).
- **Ask the management** at your current organisation to take an institutional position on this.
- [Write to your political representatives](https://www.campaignforaisafety.org/politician/).

### If you know law

- **Help draft policy** ([some](https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FLI_Policymaking_In_The_Pause.pdf)  [frameworks](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/)).
- **Make submissions to government requests for comment** on AI policy ([example](https://ntia.gov/issues/artificial-intelligence/request-for-comments)).

### If you are a politician

- **Invite (or subpoena) AI lab leaders** to parliamentary/congressional hearings to give their predictions and timelines of AI disasters.
- **Esteblish a committee** to investigate the risks of AI.
- **Work towards a summit**. Host one yourself, or get your country to host one.

### If you have money to spare

- **Donate** to the [Campaign for AI Safety](https://www.campaignforaisafety.org/donate/).

### If you can write web content

- [Improve this website](https://github.com/joepio/pauseai).

### If you work in AI

- **Talk to your management and colleagues** about the risks. Get them to take an institutional position on this.
- **Hold a seminar** on AI safety at your workplace. Check out the [videos](/learn#videos) for inspiration.
- **Sign** the [open letter](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/).

### If you work on AI safety

If you are just starting out in AI Alignment, unless you are a genius and/or have had significant new flashes of insight on the problem, **consider switching to advocacy for the Pause**. Without the Pause in place first, there just isn't time to spin up a career in Alignment to the point of making useful contributions.


If you are already established in Alignment, consider more [public communication](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1651538022360285187), and adding your name to calls for the Pause and regulation of the AI industry.

## Tips for being effective

- **Be bold in your public communication of the danger**. Don't use hedging language or caveats by default; mention them when questioned, or in footnotes, but don't make it sound like you aren't that concerned if you are.
- **Be less exacting in your work**. [80/20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) more. Don't do the classic EA/LW thing and spend months agonising and iterating on your Google doc over endless rounds of feedback. Get your project out into the world and iterate as you go. Time is of the essence.

Right now all other work is just rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic. We need to be running to the bridge, grabbing the wheel, and steering away from the iceberg. We may not have much time, but by [Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good) we can try. We can do this!
