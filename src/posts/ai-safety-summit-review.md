## The Third Major AI Summit

The AI Impact Summit, held in New Delhi on February 19-20, 2026, marked the third major international gathering on AI governance, following Bletchley Park (2023) and Paris (2025).

Delegates from over 40 countries attended, along with representatives from leading AI companies such as Anthropic. The summit focused on three key themes: safety evaluation standards, international coordination, and the role of civil society.

## Key Outcomes

### Mandatory Evaluations

One of the most significant developments was the preliminary agreement on mandatory safety evaluations for frontier AI systems. While the specifics are still being worked out, this represents a shift from the purely voluntary approach that characterized previous summits.

### Civil Society Participation

For the first time, civil society organizations including PauseAI were given formal observer status at an AI summit. Over 500 citizens from 15 countries contacted their representatives ahead of the summit, demonstrating growing public engagement with AI governance issues.

### What's Next

The next summit is tentatively scheduled for late 2027, with several working groups established to develop specific proposals in the interim. PauseAI will continue to monitor developments and advocate for binding safety standards.
