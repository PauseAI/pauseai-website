title: Cybersecurity risks of AI
description: How AI could be used to hack all devices.
---

Virtually everything we do nowadays is in some way dependent on computers.
We pay for our groceries, plan our days, contact our loved ones and even drive our cars with computers.
This makes all of us vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Highly potent cyber weapons (such as [Stuxnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd1x0csO3hU)) have always been extremely costly to create.
The [Pegasus cybersecurity weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)), for example, cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.
Finding so-called zero-day exploits (vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered) is a very hard task.
It requires a lot of skill and a lot of time to find these exploits - only highly specialized hackers can do it.
However, when AI becomes more advanced, this will no longer be the case.
Instead of having to hire a team of highly skilled security experts/hackers to find zero-day exploits, you could just use a far cheaper AI to do it for you.

The latest AI systems can already analyze and write software.
They [can find vulnerabilities](https://betterprogramming.pub/i-used-gpt-3-to-find-213-security-vulnerabilities-in-a-single-codebase-cc3870ba9411) in software, and [they could be used to exploit them](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2023/03/15/check-point-research-conducts-initial-security-analysis-of-chatgpt4-highlighting-potential-scenarios-for-accelerated-cybercrime/).
As AI capabilities grow, so will the vulnerabilities they can detect and the exploits they can create.
They are not yet as good at this as the best humans are, but they are getting closer quickly.

There will most likely come a point where an AI is better at hacking than the best human hackers.
This will make it possible to create computer viruses / cyber weapons that are far more potent than anything we have seen before.

## A Super Virus

Imagine a virus that can infect any computer, regardless of the operating system.
This is theoretically possible, but it would be extremely hard to create.
It would require analyzing the source code of all operating systems and finding (new) vulnerabilities in all of them.
No single person could do this, but a very capable AI could.
This type of Super Virus could spread to effectively all machines that have some sort of connection to other computers (through WiFi, Bluetooth, UTP, etc.).
It could then have full control over these machines.
It could steal data, spread itself, use the hardware for computations, or simply make the machine unusable.

If creating these types of viruses becomes technically feasible, someone will likely do it eventually.
It could happen by accident (e.g. by a [misaligned AI](/xrisk)), or it could happen on purpose (e.g. as a cyber weapon by a nation or terrorist).
And when that happens, the effects could be devastating.

If effectively all computers are disabled, society breaks down.
People will not be able to buy food with their credit cards or phones.
Truck drivers would not know which supermarkets to drive to.
Farmers would not be able to sell their produce or restock supplies.
The economy would grind to a halt, all supply chains would break down, and people will start to go hungry.
Societal collapse has happened often before

This is a very real threat, and we should start preparing for it now.
But more importantly: we need to prevent it from happening in the first place.
We need to make sure that AI simply is not capable of creating such a virus.
[So let's Pause AI](/proposal).
