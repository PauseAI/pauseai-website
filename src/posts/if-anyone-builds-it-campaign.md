The recently published New York Times Bestseller [_If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies_](https://ifanyonebuildsit.com/) warns of the threat of human extinction if the race to build superintelligent AI is allowed to continue.

At PauseAI, we're organising a coordinated international response to the book by hosting events across 4 countries. These book readings will provide a space for people to learn more about the book's warning, and to begin use their voice to support an international treaty pausing frontier AI development.
