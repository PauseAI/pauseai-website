The recently published New York Times Bestseller, _If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies_, warns of the threat of human extinction if the race to build superintelligent AI is allowed to continue.

At PauseAI, we're organising a coordinated international response to the book by hosting events across 4 countries. These book readings will provide a space for people to learn more about the book's warning, and to begin to take action in support of international regulation to prevent catastrophe.

Hundreds of people are already taking action by joining our **Say No to Superintelligent AI** campaign, and uploading a picture of themselves to form part of a large collage showcasing a unified stance against the race to build superintelligence.
