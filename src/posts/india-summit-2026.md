**World leaders meet in India on February 16-20 to shape the future of AI governance. Make sure they hear from you before they sit down at that table.**

PauseAI will be on the ground in New Delhi, advocating for a pause on frontier AI development and the establishment of binding international safety standards.

## Why this Summit Matters

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 follows previous gatherings at Bletchley Park, Seoul, and Paris. However, this is the first summit held in the Global South, offering a unique opportunity to center the risks that AI poses to developing nations and the need for inclusive, ethical governance.
