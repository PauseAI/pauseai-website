# Selfie Upload Feature Setup

This feature allows supporters to upload selfies for the AI safety book campaign collage.

(touched to provoke PR deploy)

## Quick Start for Developers

You have two options:

### Option A: Use Anthony's Shared Test Account (Easiest)

- Cloud name and API key are already in `.env`
- Get the `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` from Psono (shared password manager)
- You're sharing Anthony's test account - that's fine for prototyping!
- Note: Production will use a different account once we're done testing

### Option B: Use Your Own Free Cloudinary Account

Follow the setup below if you want your own isolated testing environment.

#### Creating Your Own Free Account:

1. Sign up at https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free (use GitHub login if you prefer)
2. You'll get:
   - 25GB storage
   - 25GB bandwidth/month
   - 3 user accounts
   - All features we need for testing

### 2. Configure Upload Preset

In your Cloudinary dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Upload** → **Upload Presets**
2. Click **Add upload preset**
3. Configure with these EXACT settings:
   - **Preset name**: `selfie`
   - **Signing Mode**: **Unsigned**
   - **Folder**: Leave empty (we set in code)
   - **Access control**: Leave as is

4. Under **Upload Manipulations** → **Incoming Transformation**:
   - Edit → Add transformation
   - Enter: `c_fill,g_face,ar_3:4,w_1500,h_2000,q_auto`
   - This auto-detects faces and creates consistent 3:4 portraits

5. Save the preset

### 3. Get Your Credentials

From your Cloudinary dashboard homepage, you'll see:

- **Cloud Name**: (e.g., `dyjlw1syg`)
- **API Key**: (e.g., `123456789012345`)
- **API Secret**: (keep this private!)

### 4. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Selfie Campaign - Cloudinary settings
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"  # Can be shared
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"               # Can be shared
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"         # KEEP PRIVATE - never commit!
```

**Important**:

- `API_SECRET` must NEVER be committed to source control
- `CLOUD_NAME` and `API_KEY` are safe to share
- For production, all three will be set in Netlify environment variables

### 5. Optional: Create Second Preset for Blurred Images

If you want blur to create a permanent blurred version (not just display blur):

1. Create another preset called `selfie_masked`
2. Same settings as above, but incoming transformation:
   - `c_fill,g_face,ar_3:4,w_1500,h_2000,q_auto/e_blur_faces:2000`

## Testing the Feature

1. Run development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Visit: http://localhost:5173/selfie
3. Upload a photo (camera, file, or social media)
4. Test the flow:
   - Photo should auto-crop to face
   - Blur button should work (requires API credentials)
   - Remove button should delete from Cloudinary
   - Email submission should add to metadata

## How It Works

### Upload Flow:

1. **Client**: Unsigned upload via widget → Cloudinary
2. **Cloudinary**: Applies face detection & crop
3. **Client**: Shows confirmation screen
4. **User** can:
   - Blur face (server endpoint replaces image)
   - Add email (server endpoint updates metadata)
   - Remove (server endpoint deletes from Cloudinary)

### File Organization in Cloudinary:

```
test_prototype/
  pending/     # New uploads awaiting review
  approved/    # Reviewed and approved (manual move)
```

### Tags Applied:

- `pending` - Awaiting review
- `test_prototype` - Development/testing phase
- `selfie` - Identifies as selfie upload
- `has_email` - User provided email
- `face_masked` - User requested blur

### Metadata Stored:

- `uploaded_at` - Timestamp
- `email` - If provided by user
- Plus EXIF data (camera, location if present)

## Review Process (Manual for Now)

1. Log into Cloudinary Media Library
2. Filter by tag: `pending`
3. Review images
4. Select approved images
5. Change tag from `pending` to `approved`
6. Move from `/pending` to `/approved` folder

## Troubleshooting

**"Server configuration error"**:

- Check your API credentials in `.env`
- Ensure `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` is set

**Face detection not working**:

- Check upload preset has the incoming transformation
- Some angles/lighting may challenge detection

**Blur not applying**:

- Requires valid API credentials
- Check server console for errors

## Production Notes

For production deployment:

- Cloudinary nonprofit discount available (typically 25-50% off)
- Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
- Consider webhook integration for automated approval workflow
- Email service integration for notifications

## Privacy & GDPR

- Emails stored in Cloudinary metadata (not publicly accessible)
- Users can request removal via the interface
- Face blur option provided for privacy
- Consider adding privacy policy link
