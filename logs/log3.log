# Dr. Stefano V. Albrecht: Professional Profile

## 1. Professional Background

Dr. Stefano Albrecht is a Reader (Associate Professor) in Artificial Intelligence in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, where he leads the Autonomous Agents Research Group. He currently serves as a Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) Industrial Fellow, collaborating with Dematic/KION to develop machine learning technologies for multi-robot warehouse systems. Previously, he was a Royal Society Industry Fellow, working with Five AI/Bosch on AI technologies for autonomous driving in urban environments. He is also affiliated with the Alan Turing Institute, where he leads multi-agent systems research.

Prior to his current position, Dr. Albrecht was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin in Peter Stone's research group. His educational background includes PhD and MSc degrees in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, and a BSc degree in Computer Science from Technical University of Darmstadt. He has received personal fellowships from prestigious institutions including the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Royal Society, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung). In 2022, he was nominated for the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award, a significant recognition in the field of AI.

Dr. Albrecht initially joined the University of Edinburgh as a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence. The Edinburgh Centre for Robotics welcomed him as a supervisor, noting his research interests in autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, machine learning, and game theory, with a focus on sequential decision making under uncertainty.

## 2. Involvement with AI Issues

Dr. Albrecht's research interests lie in "autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and game theory, with a focus on sequential decision making under uncertainty." The long-term goal of his research is "to create intelligent autonomous agents capable of robust interaction with other agents to accomplish tasks in complex environments."

He has been actively involved in explainable AI (XAI) research, particularly in the context of autonomous driving. He co-authored a systematic review paper titled "Explainable AI for Safe and Trustworthy Autonomous Driving" with researchers from the University of Edinburgh and the Technical University of Darmstadt. This work addresses how explainable AI techniques can help mitigate safety challenges in autonomous driving systems.

The paper notes that "Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promising applications for the perception and planning tasks in autonomous driving (AD) due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods. However, inscrutable AI systems exacerbate the existing challenge of safety assurance of AD. One way to mitigate this challenge is to utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques." Their work presents "the first comprehensive systematic literature review of explainable methods for safe and trustworthy AD."

Dr. Albrecht has supervised PhD students researching "trustworthy explainable autonomous agency in multi-agent systems for AI safety, with applications to autonomous vehicles." This research focuses on "giving AI agents the ability to explain themselves" and creating "intelligible explanations to calibrate trust in and understand the reasoning of AI agents," as well as "bridging the epistemic foundations and research problems of AI ethics and safety to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration."

## 3. Views on AI Development and Safety

In the context of AI safety, Dr. Albrecht has been associated with research that acknowledges different perspectives on AI safety: "Two distinct perspectives have emerged: one views AI safety primarily as a project for minimizing existential threats of advanced AI, while the other sees it as a natural extension of existing technological safety practices, focusing on immediate and concrete risks of current AI systems."

His research recognizes that while "Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promising applications for the perception and planning tasks in autonomous driving (AD) due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods," there are significant challenges as "inscrutable AI systems exacerbate the existing challenge of safety assurance of AD." To address this, he has contributed to developing "a modular framework called SafeX to integrate these contributions, enabling explanation delivery to users while simultaneously ensuring the safety of AI models."

In his systematic literature review on explainable AI for autonomous driving, Dr. Albrecht and colleagues emphasize that "AI shows promising applications for the perception and planning tasks in autonomous driving due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods. However, inscrutable AI systems exacerbate the existing challenge of safety assurance of AD. One way to mitigate this challenge is to utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques." Their work analyzes "the requirements for AI in the context of AD, focusing on three key aspects: data, model, and agency" and finds "that XAI is fundamental to meeting these requirements."

## 4. Recent Activities (2023-2024)

In June 2024, Dr. Albrecht "recently returned from a two-week China trip where he gave many talks at top universities and tech companies. One of the highlights was a talk at the BAAI 2024 conference (Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence) in Beijing, which is widely regarded as the most important AI conference in China and has had many big speakers."

In November 2023, it was reported that "Stefano V. Albrecht, Filippos Christianos and Lukas Schäfer have released the final version of their textbook 'Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning'"

In late 2023, Dr. Albrecht announced: "We're excited to announce that the final version of our new textbook has now been released! Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches by Stefano V. Albrecht, Filippos Christianos, Lukas Schäfer published by MIT Press, print version scheduled for late 2024."

Recent research contributions in 2024 include several publications and datasets on Edinburgh DataShare, including a paper from July 2024 with co-author M. Dunion, and another from May 2024 with E. Fosong, A. Rahman, and I. Carlucho.

I'll help you find individuals involved with AI safety in Edinburgh. Let me search for Edinburgh-based AI safety researchers.I need to search specifically for Edinburgh AI safety researchers. Let me do another search to find more specific information about individuals.Let me search for more Edinburgh AI safety researchers to get a more comprehensive list.Let me search for more information about AI safety researchers at Edinburgh, particularly those involved with the AI Safety Hub Edinburgh (AISHED).Let me search for one more Edinburgh AI safety researcher to complete my list.Based on my research, I can provide information about several Edinburgh AI safety researchers who match your description. Here are the individuals I've found:

### 1. Dr. Atoosa Kasirzadeh

Dr. Atoosa Kasirzadeh is a philosopher, mathematician, and systems engineer at the University of Edinburgh. She is an Assistant Professor (Chancellor's Fellow) in the Philosophy Department, Director of Research at the Centre for Technomoral Futures, and a Research Lead at the Alan Turing Institute. Prior to this, she held research positions at DeepMind and Australian National University. She has a PhD in Philosophy of Science and Technology (2021) from the University of Toronto and a PhD in Mathematics (2015) from the Ecole Polytechnique of Montreal. Her current research is focused on ethics, safety, and philosophy of AI (value alignment, interpretability, generative models, recommender systems) and philosophy of science.

Dr. Kasirzadeh's AI2050 project examines the value alignment problem for AI: how can we make sure that the goals and values of AI systems align with our own. Her approach—unlike other approaches which aim for a primary technical analysis—tackles the problem by integrating insights from philosophy, systems theory, game-theory, and hands-on AI expertise. It will apply multidisciplinary analysis to large language systems and their multi-modal variants to align them with human values in a responsible way.

In a recent presentation titled "Two Types of AI Existential Risk: Decisive and Accumulative," Dr. Kasirzadeh discussed how the conventional discourse on existential risks from AI typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced AI systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery.

### 2. Professor Subramanian Ramamoorthy

Professor Subramanian Ramamoorthy holds a Personal Chair of Robot Learning and Autonomy in the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, where he is also the Director of the Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour. He is an Executive Committee Member for the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics and Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute.

Professor Ramamoorthy was recently awarded the Turing AI World-Leading Researcher Fellowship. The £6 million grant will establish a bold new research center that aims to put human experience at the heart of AI and robotics research. This funding will provide a unique opportunity to establish a new mission-driven research center focused on human-centered AI, providing a dynamic inter-disciplinary environment to tackle the challenges of assistive autonomy. Creating AI systems that can learn to collaborate effectively is key to unlocking the true potential of robotics. He plans to achieve this by bringing together innovations in human skill modeling and assessment, computational models informed by cognitive neuroscience, and automated decision making for shared autonomy.

Professor Ramamoorthy's research addresses the challenges of AI being deployed in safety-critical applications involving physical interaction between humans and machines. A key focus is the need for robust decision making despite noisy sensing - providing assurances regarding their closed-loop behaviour, through novel tools for introspection and interrogation of models. One approach he investigates in detail is program induction, to reinterpret or analyse complex models by casting them in a compositional and programmatic form that is compatible with tools for analysis and safety verification.

### 3. Professor Sotirios Tsaftaris

Sotirios A. Tsaftaris is currently Chair (Full Professor) in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the University of Edinburgh. He holds the Canon Medical/Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Healthcare AI (since 2019). Since 2024, he is the Director for the EPSRC-funded Causality in Healthcare AI Hub with Real Data (CHAI). He is an ELLIS Fellow of the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) of Edinburgh's ELLIS Unit.

Professor Tsaftaris leads CHAI (Causality in Healthcare AI with Real Data), which aims to develop AI that can empower decision making tools to improve challenging tasks such as the early prediction, diagnosis and prevention of disease, and – crucially – to improve the safety of such technology in healthcare. Professor Sir Peter Mathieson, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, said: "Successful and ethical applications of AI in healthcare diagnosis and power-efficient electronics could help to address key societal issues, such as our ageing population, global energy use and climate change. It is an honour and a great opportunity for our engineers to be leading two of EPSRC's AI research hubs and I very much look forward to seeing what the future brings in terms of new technologies and innovations in AI."

Professor Sotirios (Sotos) Tsaftaris, Director of the CHAI AI Hub, said: "I'm delighted that the University of Edinburgh will be leading this world-leading consortium to develop next generation Causal AI. Causal AI holds tremendous promise for creating a new generation of AI solutions that are more robust, fair, safe, and transparent.

# Dr. Atoosa Kasirzadeh - Professional Profile

## 1. Professional Background

Dr. Atoosa Kasirzadeh is a philosopher and AI researcher with a track record of publications on ethics and governance of AI and computing. As of my most recent information, she joined Carnegie Mellon University as a tenure track Assistant Professor with joint affiliations in the Philosophy and Software & Societal Systems departments in December 2024. Previously, she was a visiting faculty at Google Research, a Chancellor's Fellow and Research Lead at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Technomoral Futures, a Group Research Lead at the Alan Turing Institute, a DCMS/UKRI Senior Policy Fellow, and a Governance of AI Fellow at Oxford.

Prior to her roles at Edinburgh and the Alan Turing Institute, she was a visiting research scientist at Google DeepMind in London and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Australian National University. She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy (2021, specialized in philosophy of science and technology) from the University of Toronto and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics (2015, specialized in large-scale algorithmic decision-making) from the Ecole Polytechnique of Montreal.

She also holds a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Systems Engineering. Her research combines quantitative, qualitative, and philosophical methods to explore questions about the societal impacts, governance, and future of AI and humanity.

## 2. Involvement with AI Issues

Dr. Kasirzadeh served as a 2023 DCMS/UKRI Senior Policy Fellow Examining Governance Implications of Generative AI. She was also the Principal Investigator for Edinburgh-Turing workshops "New Perspectives on AI Futures" (2023).

She is a 2024 Schmidt Sciences AI2050 Early Career Fellow and a Steering Committee Member for the ACM FAccT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) conference. During 2025-2027, she is serving as a council member of the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Artificial Intelligence.

Dr. Kasirzadeh has published a media piece in the Royal Society of Edinburgh magazine, titled "The Socio-Technical Challenges of Generative AI" and continues to work in this space. She writes and teaches about issues such as the ethics and philosophy of AI and computing, the roles of mathematics in empirical sciences and normative inquiry, the epistemological and social implications of mathematical and computational modeling in the socio-economic world, values in sciences and decision making, and modeling of morality.

## 3. Views on AI Development and Safety

Her current research is focused on ethics, safety, and philosophy of AI, with a particular focus on sociotechnical value alignment for generative models.

In her work on AI safety frameworks, Dr. Kasirzadeh has pointed out that "The reliance on red-teaming as a key evaluation method, while valuable, comes with its own set of fundamental limitations. The success of red-teaming depends heavily on the expertise and creativity of the testers, which may not always match the potential capabilities of malicious actors or unforeseen edge cases. Moreover, passing a red-team evaluation provides no full guarantee of safety against all possible misuse scenarios. The vast space of potential inputs, contexts, and use cases for AI systems makes it impossible to exhaustively test for all possible vulnerabilities or misuse vectors. The absence of provably safe methods for generative AI models, coupled with a limited understanding of how specific red-teaming results generalize to broader contexts, casts doubt on the ultimate reliability of any safety evaluation protocol primarily grounded in red-teaming efforts."

In a recent article for TechPolicy.Press, Dr. Kasirzadeh writes about AI safety frameworks, noting that they "represent a significant development in AI governance: they are the first type of publicly shared catastrophic risk management frameworks developed by major AI companies and focus specifically on AI scaling decisions." She identifies "six critical measurement challenges in their implementation and proposes three policy recommendations to improve their validity and reliability."

Dr. Kasirzadeh has also developed a framework on "Two Types of AI Existential Risk: Decisive and Accumulative." In this work, she examines how "the conventional discourse on existential risks (x-risks) from AI typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced AI systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery."

She has also emphasized that "AI will reshape critical infrastructure, labor markets, and civic discourse long before it poses species‑level dangers," suggesting a more immediate and practical approach to AI safety concerns.

## 4. Recent Activities

Her recent research has been made possible through funding from several bodies, including the AI2050 program at Schmidt Sciences (Grant 24-66924) and the UKRI Arts and Humanities Research Council (grant AH/X007146/1).

## 5. Communication Style and Key Terms

In her research, Dr. Kasirzadeh focuses on AI safety and ethics, including topics such as algorithmic transparency and accountability, algorithmic fairness and justice, and ethical and social implications of generative AI models and recommender systems.

In discussing algorithmic fairness, she has cautioned about "the use of counterfactuals for considerations of algorithmic fairness and explainability" which is "gaining prominence within the machine learning community and industry." She "argues for more caution with the use of counterfactuals when the facts to be considered are social categories such as race or gender," based on a broad review of philosophical literature.

In her work on generative AI, she investigates "how generative AI can potentially undermine the integrity of collective knowledge and the processes we rely on to acquire, assess, and trust information, posing a significant threat to our knowledge ecosystem and democratic discourse." Her approach is "grounded in social and political philosophy."

Key terms she frequently uses include: AI ethics, AI safety, algorithmic fairness, value alignment, interpretability, generative models, recommender systems, technomoral futures, sociotechnical systems, and catastrophic risk governance.

## 6. Notable Connections

I've noted your observation that "AI will reshape critical infrastructure, labor markets, and civic discourse long before it poses species-level dangers," which seems to suggest focusing on immediate governance challenges. Your critiques of red-teaming limitations in AI safety evaluation also raise important questions about how we're currently approaching safety. As AI capabilities continue to advance, the gap between technological progress and safety guardrails seems to be widening. Your perspective on how ordinary citizens can meaningfully support responsible AI development would be invaluable as I try to engage with these complex issues.

Would you be willing to share resources or direct me to public discussions where I might learn more about your team's approach to AI safety, particularly regarding the balance between addressing immediate concerns versus existential risks? I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide, even if just a few links to relevant work from your research group. Your insights would help me become a more informed participant in the public discourse around AI governance.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this important matter.

You are a helpful AI assistant.

Note: Some fields in the information may begin with a robot emoji (🤖). This indicates the field was automatically generated during research. You can use this information normally, just ignore the emoji marker.
What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.

Here's information about 4 key individuals:

# AI Safety Researchers in Scotland

## 1. Professor Helen Hastie

Professor Helen Hastie is the Head of the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh and a Royal Academy of Engineering/Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellow. She specializes in Human-Robot Interaction and Multimodal interfaces, having undertaken projects including AI personal assistants for remote robots, autonomous systems, and spoken dialogue systems for sectors in defense and energy.

Professor Hastie is committed to responsible research and ethical design in AI, stating: "Thinking about responsible research and ethical design is vital from day one, not as an afterthought. We want AI to be safe, effective, and trustworthy." She works with the University's Centre for Technomoral Futures, led by Professor Shannon Vallor, who is recognized globally as an expert in technology ethics.

In her role at the University of Edinburgh, she leads GAIL (Generative Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) alongside her colleague Professor Mirella Lapata. Hastie emphasizes that while GAIL is based in the School of Informatics due to its "critical mass of AI and machine learning experts," it's a University-wide initiative that connects with other disciplines including "medicine, engineering, business, law, geosciences" and others.

Her research focuses on "multimodal and spoken dialogue systems, human-robot interaction and trustworthy autonomous systems." She has published over 120 papers and has served on various scientific committees and advisory boards, including the Scottish Government AI Strategy.

## 2. Professor Michael Rovatsos

Professor Michael Rovatsos is a leading AI researcher whose work since around 2014 has focused on ethical AI, developing "architectures and algorithms that support transparency, accountability, fairness, and diversity-awareness." His approach is practical rather than speculative, as he is "most interested in making sure the concrete computational mechanisms used by AI-driven systems are aligned with human values." In a multiagent systems context, his work involves "creating mechanisms to elicit users' and stakeholders' views and translate them into concrete constraints and optimisation criteria for algorithms and design principles for algorithms."

He is Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Deputy Vice Principal of Research at the University of Edinburgh, where he also heads up the Bayes Centre, the University's data science and AI innovation hub. With over 20 years of experience in AI research, his focus has been on multiagent systems, "intelligent systems where artificial and/or human agents collaborate or compete with each other." His work on ethical aspects of AI involves "developing methods for designing fair and diversity-aware AI algorithms that respect the values of human users." He has published around 100 scientific articles on various AI topics and has been involved in research projects receiving over £17 million in external funding.

His research specifically "focuses on the social elements of AI, understanding how computer systems with multiple AI-powered parts interact. At its core, it's about trying to give intelligent machines the ability to reason, argue and resolve problems when faced with conflicting information or objectives."

Professor Rovatsos has "worked a lot on the ethical aspects of AI" and believes that "if you're going to put new technology out there, you have to make sure it's not harmful."

## 3. Professor Shannon Vallor

Professor Shannon Vallor serves as Director of the Centre for Technomoral Futures in the Edinburgh Futures Institute and is Programme Director for EFI's MSc in Data and AI Ethics. She holds the Baillie Gifford Chair in the Ethics of Data and Artificial Intelligence in the University of Edinburgh's Department of Philosophy.

Professor Vallor joined the Futures Institute in 2020 after a career in the United States as a leader in the ethics of emerging technologies, including working as a visiting AI Ethicist at Google from 2018-2020. She is the author of "The AI Mirror: How to Reclaim Our Humanity in an Age of Machine Thinking" (Oxford University Press, 2024) and "Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting" (Oxford University Press, 2016).

She serves as an advisor to government and industry bodies on responsible AI and data ethics and is the Principal Investigator and Co-Director (with Professor Ewa Luger) of the UKRI research programme BRAID (Bridging Responsible AI Divides), funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

Her research "explores how new technologies, especially AI, robotics, and data science, reshape human moral character, habits, and practices." Her work includes advising policymakers and industry on the ethical design and use of AI. She is a standing member of the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence (AI100) and a member of the Oversight Board of the Ada Lovelace Institute. She received the 2015 World Technology Award in Ethics from the World Technology Network and the 2022 Covey Award from the International Association of Computing and Philosophy.

## 4. Professor Crawford Revie

Professor Crawford Revie is a Professor of Data Analytics in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Strathclyde. His research "takes place at the intersection of informatics and the life sciences," with extensive work on "data-driven models of disease and host-parasite dynamics in both human and animal populations." He has interests in "novel methods to collect, manage and make statistical inferences from large and heterogeneous data sets," with ongoing research in the application of such methods for "passive (or syndromic) surveillance of disease."

His work at Strathclyde's Human Centric AI Research Group demonstrates his expertise in applying AI methods to complex data analysis. He brings a perspective on AI safety through his work with "novel methods to collect, manage and make statistical inferences from large and heterogeneous data sets," which is crucial for ensuring AI systems work properly with real-world data.

These researchers represent Scotland's strong contribution to AI safety research, approaching the field from different angles including human-robot interaction, ethical algorithm design, philosophy of technology, and data analytics for complex systems.

for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.
Rate limit test:

Note: Some fields in the information may begin with a robot emoji (🤖). This indicates the field was automatically generated during research. You can use this information normally, just ignore the emoji marker.
What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:

You are a helpful AI assistant.

Note: Some fields in the information may begin with a robot emoji (🤖). This indicates the field was automatically generated during research. You can use this information normally, just ignore the emoji marker.
What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.
Stress test 2:
Subject: Load test
Target: Test person
Please replace all mentions of 'undefined' with the apropriate information that should
go in that space, derived from the rest of the information. 

Important: For any field you fill in that was originally 'undefined' or empty, prefix 
your answer with a robot emoji (🤖) to indicate it was automatically generated.

Example:
Original: "Preferred communication style: undefined"
Your output: "Preferred communication style: 🤖 Formal but approachable"

Please remember that you are addressing this person, and try to make all inferences based on the information provided and your own knowledge. Err on the side of caution: if you are unsure, be polite and neutral.

Output the full information, including your edits. Output nothing else.

What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.

The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.

of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.
Stress test 21:

What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on.

I'll help you find AI safety researchers at MIT. Let me search for current information about individuals who match this description.Let me search for more specific information about AI safety researchers at MIT, particularly looking for faculty names and their safety-focused work.Now let me search for other MIT AI safety researchers to provide a comprehensive list.Let me search for a few more MIT AI safety researchers to complete the list.Based on my searches, here are 4 MIT AI safety researchers who match your description:

## 1. Aleksander Madry
**Position:** Cadence Design Systems Professor of Computing at MIT, leads the MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning as well as is a faculty co-lead for the MIT AI Policy Forum

**Relevance to AI Safety:** Most of my research is focused on meeting this challenge. Specifically, I work on developing next-generation machine-learning systems that will be reliable and secure enough for mission-critical applications like self-driving cars and software that filters malicious content

**Organization:** Professor and TRAC Faculty Lead, MIT CSAIL and The Trustworthy and Robust AI collaboration (TRAC) between MIT CSAIL and Microsoft Research is working towards fostering advances on robustness and trustworthy AI, which spans safety & reliability, intelligibility, and accountability. The collaboration seeks to address concerns about the trustworthiness of AI systems, including rising concerns with the safety, fairness, and transparency of technologies

**Public Stance:** compares AI to a sharp knife, a useful but potentially-hazardous tool that society must learn to wield properly. He emphasizes the need for reliable in most situations and can withstand outside interference; in engineering terms, that they are robust. We also need to understand the reasoning behind their decisions; that they are interpretable

## 2. Dylan Hadfield-Menell
**Position:** Bonnie and Marty (1964) Tenenbaum Career Development Assistant Professor of EECS Faculty of Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory

**Relevance to AI Safety:** Dylan's research focuses on the problem of agent alignment: the challenge of identifying behaviors that are consistent with the goals of another actor or group of actors. Dylan runs the Algorithmic Alignment Group, where they work to identify algorithmic solutions to alignment problems that arise from groups of AI systems, principal-agent pairs (i.e., human-robot teams), and societal oversight of ML systems

**Organization:** MIT CSAIL - Hadfield-Menell runs the Algorithmic Alignment Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT

**Public Stance:** The nature of what a human or group of humans values is fundamentally complex — it is unlikely, if not impossible, that we can provide a complete specification of value to an AI system. As a result, AI systems may cause harm or catastrophe by optimizing an incorrect objective. He's particularly concerned with systems that evolve over time to adapt to new conditions and develop secondary goals—like an AI that cheats to achieve its primary goal

## 3. Jacob Andreas
**Position:** associate professor at MIT in EECS and CSAIL

**Relevance to AI Safety:** While primarily focused on natural language processing, Andreas has increasingly engaged with AI safety concerns. Language is an important and underutilized tool when it comes to understanding AI. Humans use language to communicate with one another and explain our own decisions. His work on model interpretability contributes to AI safety through techniques for understanding machine learning models using language. Many machine learning models, especially neural networks, are black boxes---their decision-making processes are difficult to explain or audit for correctness. Prof. Andreas's students have developed techniques that provide natural language descriptions of deep networks and their procedures; these tools have in turn revealed new failure modes and unexpected behaviors in widely used image classification models

**Organization:** MIT CSAIL - Jacob Andreas leads the Language and Intelligence Group at MIT

**Public Stance:** There's a little danger in rushing to deploy these tools right away, and that we'll wind up in a world where everything's a little bit worse, but where it's actually very difficult for people to actually reliably check the outputs of these models. That being said, these are problems that can be overcome. The pace that things are moving at especially, there's a lot of room to address these issues of factuality and coherence and correctness of generated code in the long term. He has also served as independent external reviews from four reviewers: Prof. Jacob Andreas for Anthropic's alignment faking research.

## 4. Daniela Rus
**Position:** Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT

**Relevance to AI Safety:** While her primary focus is robotics, she leads safety-oriented research including develop a framework that can ensure and certify the safety of an autonomous vehicle. By leveraging research from the area of formal verification, this framework aims to assess the safety, i.e., free of collisions, of a broad class of autonomous car controllers/planners for a given traffic model

**Organization:** MIT CSAIL - Director

**Public Stance:** By quantifying uncertainty, we're getting closer to designing the novel transparent systems that can function in high-stakes environments. Our goal here is to create a principled approach for robust machine learning – in theory and practice. She leads the collaboration with Microsoft Research focused on trustworthy and robust AI, which spans safety & reliability, intelligibility, and accountability

These researchers represent a strong concentration of AI safety expertise at MIT, covering areas from robustness and reliability (Madry), alignment and value specification (Hadfield-Menell), interpretability through language (Andreas), and safety in autonomous systems (Rus).

I'll help you find AI researchers working on existential risk. Let me search for relevant individuals in this field.Let me search for more specific information about prominent AI safety researchers and their organizations.Now let me search for information about other prominent AI safety researchers working on existential risk.Let me search for more specific information about other key AI safety researchers.Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about several prominent AI researchers working on existential risk. Here are 4 key individuals who match your criteria:

## 1. Stuart Russell
**Current Position:** Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and holds the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering at University of California, Berkeley

**Relevance to AI Safety:** In 2016, he founded the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley and leads the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley and the International Association for Safe and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (IASEAI). Russell is widely regarded as a leading voice in AI safety research.

**Organization:** Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley

**Public Stance:** In March 2023, Russell signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4". In a January 2025 article in Newsweek, Russell wrote "In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff."

## 2. Eliezer Yudkowsky
**Current Position:** He is the founder of and a research fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), a private research nonprofit based in Berkeley, California

**Relevance to AI Safety:** Eliezer S. Yudkowsky is an American artificial intelligence researcher and writer on decision theory and ethics, best known for popularizing ideas related to friendly artificial intelligence. A decision theorist who did not attend high school or college, Yudkowsky is one of the founders of the field of AI alignment, which aims to prevent Terminator-like scenarios by making sure that AI systems do what their creators want them to do.

**Organization:** The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), formerly the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), is a non-profit research institute focused since 2005 on identifying and managing potential existential risks from artificial general intelligence

**Public Stance:** Yudkowsky has spent more than two decades warning that powerful AI systems could, and likely will, kill all of humanity. Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die.

## 3. Nick Bostrom
**Current Position:** He was the founding director of the now dissolved Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford and is now Principal Researcher at the Macrostrategy Research Initiative

**Relevance to AI Safety:** Nick Bostrom is a philosopher known for his work on existential risk, the anthropic principle, human enhancement ethics, whole brain emulation, superintelligence risks, and the reversal test. Bostrom is the author of Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (2002), Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014) and Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World (2024).

**Organization:** Nick Bostrom established the institute in November 2005 as part of the Oxford Martin School (Future of Humanity Institute, now closed). He is currently the founder and Director of Research of the Macrostrategy Research Initiative.

**Public Stance:** Bostrom believes that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to superintelligence, which he defines as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest". He discusses existential risk, which he defines as one in which an "adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential".

## 4. Researchers at Key Organizations

**Center for AI Safety (CAIS):** AI Safety Researcher, Truthful AI · Sawyer Bernath · Other Notable Figures · Executive Director, Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative · Lewis Hammond · Other Notable Figures · Acting Executive Director, Cooperative AI Foundation · Eliezer Yudkowsky · Other Notable Figures · Senior Research Fellow and Co-Founder, Machine Intelligence Research Institute · Nate Soares · Other Notable Figures · Executive Director, Machine Intelligence Research Institute

**Current Research Focus:** CAIS focusses on mitigating risks that could lead to catastrophic outcomes for society, such as bioterrorism or loss of control over military AI systems. Advanced AI development could invite catastrophe, rooted in four key risks described in our research: malicious use, AI races, organizational risks, and rogue AIs.

**Public Stance:** Worries peaked in May 2023 when the nonprofit research and advocacy organization Center for AI Safety released a one-sentence statement: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war." The statement was signed by many key players in the field, including the leaders of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, as well as two of the so-called "godfathers" of AI: Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio.

These researchers represent some of the most prominent voices in AI existential risk research, with established track records in the field and clear public positions on the importance of AI safety work.

I'll help you find AI safety researchers who work on existential risk. Let me search for current information about prominent individuals in this field.Let me search for specific prominent AI safety researchers to get more detailed information about individual experts.Let me search for other prominent AI safety researchers to find additional individuals working on existential risk.Let me search for information about the Center for AI Safety and its key researchers.Based on my research, I'll provide you with detailed information about prominent AI safety researchers working on existential risk. Here are 5 key individuals:

## 1. Stuart Russell
**Current Position:** Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, holder of the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** His current concerns include the threat of autonomous weapons and the long-term future of artificial intelligence and its relation to humanity. In March 2023, Russell signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4". The letter has been signed by over 30,000 individuals, including AI researchers such as Yoshua Bengio and Gary Marcus.

**Organization:** He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley and the International Association for Safe and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (IASEAI)

**Public Stance:** In a January 2025 article in Newsweek, Russell wrote "In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff." The latter topic is the subject of his new book, "Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control" (Viking/Penguin, 2019)

## 2. Geoffrey Hinton
**Current Position:** At 76, Hinton is retired after what he calls 10 happy years at Google. Now, he's professor emeritus at the University of Toronto

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** Hinton has been called "the Godfather of AI," a British computer scientist whose controversial ideas helped make advanced artificial intelligence possible and, so, changed the world. As we first reported last year, Hinton believes that AI will do enormous good but, tonight, he has a warning. In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of A.I." He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors, technological unemployment, and existential risk from artificial general intelligence.

**Organization:** Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing", together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun for their work on deep learning. He was also awarded, along with John Hopfield, the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks

**Public Stance:** At Christmas 2024 he had become somewhat more pessimistic, saying that there was a "10 to 20 per cent chance" that AI would be the cause of human extinction within the following three decades (he had previously suggested a 10% chance, without a timescale). He expressed surprise at the speed with which AI was advancing, and said that most experts expected AI to advance, probably in the next 20 years, to be "smarter than people ... a scary thought

## 3. Dan Hendrycks
**Current Position:** Dan Hendrycks (born 1994 or 1995) is an American machine learning researcher. He serves as the director of the Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** Hendrycks' research focuses on topics that include machine learning safety, machine ethics, and robustness. This was followed by "An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks", which discusses four categories of risks: malicious use, AI race dynamics, organizational risks, and rogue AI agents.

**Organization:** CAIS reduces societal-scale risks from AI through research, field-building, and advocacy. CAIS conducts research solely focused on improving the safety of AIs

**Public Stance:** In May 2023, the Center for AI Safety released a statement signed by numerous experts in AI safety and the AI existential risk which stated: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." And within two, he says, AI could have so much runaway power that it can't be pulled back

## 4. Max Tegmark
**Current Position:** Max Tegmark argues that "from a game-theoretic point of view, this race is not an arms race but a suicide race[…] Because we are closer to building AGI than we are to figuring out how to align or control it." ... It came from Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, a Narberth, Penn.-based non-profit

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** Max Tegmark, the president of the Future of Life Institute, told me, "People would think you were insane if you started talking about this last year." He has been actively involved in organizing AI safety statements and initiatives.

**Organization:** Future of Life Institute

**Public Stance:** Max Tegmark argues that "from a game-theoretic point of view, this race is not an arms race but a suicide race[…] Because we are closer to building AGI than we are to figuring out how to align or control it."

## 5. Researchers at RAND Corporation
**Current Position:** Michael J.D. Vermeer is a senior physical scientist at RAND who studies science and technology policy research in relation to homeland security, criminal justice, the intelligence community, and the armed forces

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** RAND takes big threats to humanity seriously, so I, skeptical about AI's human extinction potential, proposed a project to research whether it could. My team's hypothesis was this: No scenario can be described where AI is conclusively an extinction threat to humanity. In other words, our starting hypothesis was that humans were too adaptable, too plentiful, and too dispersed across the planet for AI to wipe us out using any tools hypothetically at its disposal

**Organization:** RAND Corporation

**Public Stance:** It also makes sense to invest in AI safety research, whether or not you buy the argument that AI is a potential extinction risk. The same responsible AI development approaches that mitigate risk from extinction will also mitigate risks from other AI-related harms that are less consequential, and also less uncertain, than existential risks

These researchers represent a mix of technical AI experts, policy researchers, and safety advocates who are actively working on understanding and mitigating existential risks from artificial intelligence through research, advocacy, and policy engagement.

I'll help you find AI safety researchers who work on existential risk. Let me search for current information about prominent individuals in this field.Let me search for specific prominent AI safety researchers and organizations to get more detailed information about individuals.Based on my research, I've found several prominent AI safety researchers who work on existential risk. Here are 4 key individuals you could consider contacting:

## 1. **Dan Hendrycks**
- **Current Position**: Director of the Center for AI Safety
- **Organization**: Center for AI Safety (CAIS)
- **Relevance to AI Safety**: Published "An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks", which discusses four categories of risks: malicious use, AI race dynamics, organizational risks, and rogue AI agents. In September 2022, Hendrycks wrote a paper providing a framework for analyzing the impact of AI research on societal risks.
- **Public Stance**: In May 2023, the Center for AI Safety released a statement signed by numerous experts in AI safety and the AI existential risk which stated: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." He advocates for conducting safety research, building the field of AI safety researchers, and advocating for safety standards.

## 2. **Geoffrey Hinton**
- **Current Position**: University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto
- **Organization**: University of Toronto (formerly Google until 2023)
- **Relevance to AI Safety**: Known as "the Godfather of AI" for his work on artificial neural networks. In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of A.I." He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors, technological unemployment, and existential risk from artificial general intelligence.
- **Public Stance**: At Christmas 2024 he had become somewhat more pessimistic, saying that there was a "10 to 20 per cent chance" that AI would be the cause of human extinction within the following three decades. He expressed surprise at the speed with which AI was advancing, and said that most experts expected AI to advance, probably in the next 20 years, to be "smarter than people ... a scary thought."

## 3. **Stuart Russell**
- **Current Position**: Professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley and holds the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering
- **Organization**: UC Berkeley and director of the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence
- **Relevance to AI Safety**: Author of possibly the most popular AI textbook in the world, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", and his book "Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Control Problem". His research over the last decade has focused on the problem of control: how do we maintain power, forever, over entities that will eventually become more powerful than us?
- **Public Stance**: Russell and postdoctoral scholar Michael Cohen say that if left unchecked, powerful AI systems may pose an existential threat to the future of humanity. In March 2023, Russell signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4".

## 4. **Yoshua Bengio**
- **Current Position**: Professor at the Université de Montréal and scientific director of the AI institute MILA
- **Organization**: Mila – Quebec AI Institute
- **Relevance to AI Safety**: Received the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing", together with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are sometimes referred to as the "Godfathers of AI". At the first AI Safety Summit in November 2023, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that Bengio would lead an international scientific report on the safety of advanced AI.
- **Public Stance**: In March 2023, following concerns raised by AI experts about the existential risk from artificial general intelligence, Bengio signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4". He has stated that "given the magnitude of the potentially negative impact (up to human extinction), it is imperative to invest more in both understanding and quantifying the risks and developing mitigating solutions".

All four researchers are highly credible voices in AI safety and have publicly advocated for taking existential risks from AI seriously, making them excellent contacts for your purposes.

I'll help you find AI safety researchers who work on existential risk. Let me search for individuals who match this description.Let me search for specific prominent AI safety researchers to get more detailed information about individuals.Now let me search for some other prominent AI safety researchers to provide a well-rounded list.Let me search for one more prominent AI safety researcher to round out the list.Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about several prominent AI safety researchers who work on existential risk. Here are 4 key individuals you could contact:

## 1. Geoffrey Hinton - "The Godfather of AI"

**Current Position:** University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023, citing concerns about the many risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. At Christmas 2024 he had become somewhat more pessimistic, saying that there was a "10 to 20 per cent chance" that AI would be the cause of human extinction within the following three decades.

**Organization:** Former Google Brain, now independent; Vector Institute advisor

**Public Stance:** In May 2023, the Center for AI Safety released a statement signed by numerous experts in AI safety and the AI existential risk which stated: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." The statement was signed by many key players in the field, including the leaders of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, as well as two of the so-called "godfathers" of AI: Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio. According to Hinton, AI companies should dedicate significantly more resources to safety research — "like a third" of their computing power, compared to the much smaller fraction currently allocated.

## 2. Stuart Russell - Leading AI Safety Researcher

**Current Position:** He is a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley... He holds the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering at University of California, Berkeley

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** In 2016, he founded the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley... Russell is the co-author with Peter Norvig of the authoritative textbook of the field of AI: Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach used in more than 1,500 universities in 135 countries. Russell was born in Portsmouth, England... He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley and the International Association for Safe and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (IASEAI)

**Organization:** UC Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible AI (Director), International Association for Safe and Ethical AI (President)

**Public Stance:** In March 2023, Russell signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4"... In a January 2025 article in Newsweek, Russell wrote "In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff." Professor Stuart Russell, IASEAI President and Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley said: "The development of highly capable AI is likely to be the biggest event in human history. The world must act decisively to ensure it is not the last event in human history".

## 3. Max Tegmark - Future of Life Institute President

**Current Position:** Tegmark is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the president of the Future of Life Institute

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** FLI was founded in March 2014 by MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, DeepMind research scientist Viktoriya Krakovna, Tufts University postdoctoral scholar Meia Chita-Tegmark, and UCSC physicist Anthony Aguirre. Please give one or more examples of research interests relevant to AI existential safety: I believe that our best shot at beneficial AGI involves replacing black-box neural networks by intelligible intelligence. The only way I'll trust a superintelligence to be beneficial is if I can prove it, since no matter how smart it is, it can't do the impossible. My MIT research group therefore focuses on using tools from physics and information theory to transform black-box neural networks into more understandable systems.

**Organization:** Future of Life Institute (President), MIT (Professor)

**Public Stance:** An AGI race is a suicide race. The proposed AGI Manhattan project, and the fundamental misunderstanding that underpins it, represents an insidious growing threat to US national security. Any system better than humans at general cognition and problem solving would by definition be better than humans at AI research and development, and therefore able to improve and replicate itself at a terrifying rate. In March 2023, FLI published a letter titled "Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter". This called on major AI developers to agree on a verifiable six-month pause of any systems "more powerful than GPT-4" and to use that time to institute a framework for ensuring safety.

## 4. Center for AI Safety (CAIS) Researchers

**Organization:** CAIS focusses on mitigating risks that could lead to catastrophic outcomes for society, such as bioterrorism or loss of control over military AI systems

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** Advanced AI development could invite catastrophe, rooted in four key risks described in our research: malicious use, AI races, organizational risks, and rogue AIs. These interconnected risks can also amplify other existential risks like engineered pandemics, nuclear war, great power conflict, totalitarianism, and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure — warranting serious concern

**Public Stance:** A statement jointly signed by a historic coalition of experts: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."

These researchers represent leading voices in AI existential safety research and would be excellent contacts for your inquiry about AI safety and existential risk concerns.

## 1. Stuart Russell
**Name and Current Position:** Stuart Jonathan Russell OBE FRS (born 1962) is a British computer scientist known for his contributions to artificial intelligence (AI). He is a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley and was from 2008 to 2011 an adjunct professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. He holds the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering at University of California, Berkeley.

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley and the International Association for Safe and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (IASEAI). His current concerns include the threat of autonomous weapons and the long-term future of artificial intelligence and its relation to humanity.

**Organization:** In 2016, he founded the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley, with co-principal investigators Pieter Abbeel, Anca Dragan, Tom Griffiths, Bart Selman, Joseph Halpern, Michael Wellman and Satinder Singh Baveja.

**Public Stance:** In March 2023, Russell signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4". The letter has been signed by over 30,000 individuals, including AI researchers such as Yoshua Bengio and Gary Marcus. In a January 2025 article in Newsweek, Russell wrote "In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff."

## 2. Nick Bostrom
**Name and Current Position:** Nick Bostrom is a Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy at Oxford University and founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute and the Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology within the Oxford Martin School. Note: The Future of Humanity Institute closed on 16 April 2024.

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** He is the author of some 200 publications, including Anthropic Bias (2002), Global Catastrophic Risks (2008), Human Enhancement (2009), and Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014), a New York Times bestseller which helped spark a global conversation about the future of AI. He has also published a series of influential papers, including ones that introduced the simulation argument (2003) and the concept of existential risk (2002).

**Organization:** The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) was an interdisciplinary research centre at the University of Oxford investigating big-picture questions about humanity and its prospects. It was founded in 2005 as part of the Faculty of Philosophy and the Oxford Martin School. Nick Bostrom established the institute in November 2005 as part of the Oxford Martin School, then the James Martin 21st Century School.

**Public Stance:** Most recently, FHI has focused on the dangers of advanced artificial intelligence (AI). In 2014, its researchers published several books on AI risk, including Stuart Armstrong's Smarter Than Us and Bostrom's Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. He is best known for his work in five areas: (i) existential risk; (ii) the simulation argument; (iii) anthropics (developing the first mathematically explicit theory of observation selection effects); (iv) impacts of future technology; and (v) implications of consequentialism for global strategy.

## 3. Eliezer Yudkowsky
**Name and Current Position:** Eliezer S. Yudkowsky (/ˌɛliˈɛzər jʌdˈkaʊski/ EL-ee-EZ-ər yud-KOW-skee; born September 11, 1979) is an American artificial intelligence researcher and writer on decision theory and ethics, best known for popularizing ideas related to friendly artificial intelligence. He is the founder of and a research fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), a private research nonprofit based in Berkeley, California.

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** Eliezer Yudkowsky is a decision theorist who is widely cited for his writings on the long-term future of artificial intelligence. His views on the social and philosophical significance of AI have had a major impact on ongoing debates in the field, and as MIRI's senior research fellow, his work in mathematical logic has heavily shaped MIRI's research agenda.

**Organization:** The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), formerly the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), is a non-profit research institute focused since 2005 on identifying and managing potential existential risks from artificial general intelligence.

**Public Stance:** Yudkowsky has spent more than two decades warning that powerful AI systems could, and likely will, kill all of humanity. A decision theorist who did not attend high school or college, Yudkowsky is one of the founders of the field of AI alignment, which aims to prevent Terminator-like scenarios by making sure that AI systems do what their creators want them to do. On April 1, 2022, he announced that MIRI was changing its mission to "Death With Dignity," estimating the chances of human survival to be 0%. This was no April Fools' joke: MIRI doesn't do 401(k) matching, because, a spokesperson explains, they believe that AI will be "so disruptive to humanity's future—for worse or for better—that the notion of traditional retirement planning is moot."

## 4. Dario Amodei
**Name and Current Position:** Dario Amodei (born 1983) is an American artificial intelligence researcher and entrepreneur. He is the co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, the company behind the large language model series Claude.

**Why Relevant to AI Safety:** Dario Amodei is the CEO of Anthropic, a public benefit corporation dedicated to building AI systems that are steerable, interpretable and safe. I think and talk a lot about the risks of powerful AI. The company I'm the CEO of, Anthropic, does a lot of research on how to reduce these risks.

**Organization:** Anthropic - In 2021, Amodei and his sister Daniela founded Anthropic along with other former senior members of OpenAI. The Amodei siblings were among those who left OpenAI due to directional differences.

**Public Stance:** In July 2023, Amodei warned a United States Senate judiciary panel of the dangers of AI, including the risks it poses in the development and control of weaponry. Dario Amodei — CEO of Anthropic, one of the world's most powerful creators of artificial intelligence — has a blunt, scary warning for the U.S. government and all of us: AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years, Amodei told us in an interview from his San Francisco office. Amodei said AI companies and government need to stop "sugar-coating" what's coming: the possible mass elimination of jobs across technology, finance, law, consulting and other white-collar professions, especially entry-level gigs.

## 5. Center for AI Safety (CAIS) Leadership
While not focusing on a single individual, it's worth noting that In May 2023, the Center for AI Safety released a statement signed by numerous experts in AI safety and the AI existential risk which stated: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." The statement was signed by many key players in the field, including the leaders of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, as well as two of the so-called "godfathers" of AI: Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio.

These researchers represent different approaches to AI safety work - from technical research and alignment (Russell, Yudkowsky) to philosophical frameworks (Bostrom) to industry leadership focused on safe development (Amodei). All are actively engaged in addressing what they view as potentially existential risks from advanced AI systems.

Note: Some fields in the information may begin with a robot emoji (🤖). This indicates the field was automatically generated during research. You can use this information normally, just ignore the emoji marker.
What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.

You are a helpful AI assistant.

Note: Some fields in the information may begin with a robot emoji (🤖). This indicates the field was automatically generated during research. You can use this information normally, just ignore the emoji marker.
What follows is the anatomy of a good email, a set of guidelines and
criteria for writing a good mail. Each paragraph, except the last represents 
a distinct part of the email.

Subject line:
The subject line should be short, informative and clearly communicate
the goal of the mail. It must grab the attention and capture the
interest of the recipient. Avoid cliché language.

Greeting:
The greeting must match the tone of the mail. If possible, address the
recipient by the appropriate title. Keep it short, and mention the reason
for the mail. Establish a strong connection with the recipient: Are they
a politician meant to represent you? Is it regarding something they've
recently done? Make the recipient feel like they owe you an answer.

First paragraph:
Explain what the purpose of the email is. It must be concise and captivating,
most people who receive many emails learn to quickly dismiss many. Make
sure the relation is established and they have a reason to read on. 

Body paragraph:
The main body of the email should be informative and contain the information
of the mail. Take great care not to overwhelm the reader: it must be
logically structured and not too full of facts. The message should remain 
clear and the relation to the greeting and first paragraph must remain clear.
It should not be too long, otherwise it might get skimmed. Links to further
information can be provided.

Conclusion:
Keep this short and sweet. Make sure it has a CLEAR CALL TO ACTION!
Restate the reason the recipient should feel the need to act. Thank them
for their time and/or your ask.

General:
Make sure the formatting isn't too boring. Write in a manner the recipient
would respond well to: Do not argue with them, do not mention views they
probably won't share. Try to play to things they said before and that fit
their persona. Keep the tone consistent and not too emotional. Do not sound
crazy.

Please replace all mentions of 'undefined' with the apropriate information that should

I'll help you find some key individuals involved in AI safety. I'll do a web search to identify prominent researchers in this field.Based on the search results, I'll highlight several key individuals in AI safety:

1. Stuart Russell
- Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, leading the Center for Human-compatible AI. He co-authored the standard AI textbook used in over 1,500 universities across 135 countries
- He is critical of current AI safety approaches, arguing that:
  - Current safety activities are not very effective
  - There are no quantitative safety guarantees
  - The current approach of using "giant black boxes trained on unimaginably vast quantities of data" may be a "dead end"

2. Dan Hendrycks
- Works at the Center for AI Safety (CAIS), focusing on mitigating societal-scale risks posed by AI
- Creates foundational benchmarks and methods to address technical challenges
- His research explores how AI evolution might lead to undesirable traits, with selfish AI potentially having an advantage over altruistic systems. He argues that resolving this challenge is necessary to ensure positive AI development

3. Dawn Song
- Professor in AI at UC Berkeley, most-cited researcher in AI security and privacy
- Views AI as "the biggest opportunity and at the same time the biggest risk for mankind"

4. Yoshua Bengio
- Professor at Université de Montreal and Founder of Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute
- Recipient of the 2018 A.M. Turing Award
- Part of a panel assessing safety standards of prominent AI companies, evaluating them across categories like Risk Assessment, Current Harms, Safety Frameworks, and Transparency

Context of AI Safety:
- AI risk has emerged as a global priority, ranking alongside pandemics and nuclear war
- Currently, society is ill-prepared to manage AI risks
- Organizations like CAIS aim to equip policymakers and leaders with tools to manage AI risk

Challenges:
- Current research into AI safety is seriously lacking, with only 1-3% of AI publications concerning safety
- There are no adequate mechanisms to prevent misuse of autonomous systems that can independently take actions and pursue goals

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these researchers or provide more information about their work in AI safety?
