# PauseAI Website - Developer Notes (Anthony)

This file is symlinked as CLAUDE.md (gitignored) so Claude Code reads it.
Convention: each developer can have their own `.{username}.CLAUDE.md` tracked in the repo.

## Project Overview

SvelteKit website for PauseAI. Uses Paraglide for i18n/l10n.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- Paraglide (localization)
- pnpm
- Node 24.2.0 (see .nvmrc)
- Deployed via Netlify

## Key Directories

- `src/` - SvelteKit source
- `messages/` - Paraglide translation files
- `l10n-cage/` - Localization tooling
- `scripts/` - Build/utility scripts

## Dev Server

Port is explicitly set to **37572** in vite.config.ts (not Vite's default 5173).

## iOS Safari Testing (AWS Device Farm)

Real device testing for iOS Safari layout issues that Playwright WebKit doesn't catch.

**Setup**: See `scripts/device-farm/README.md` for full details.

**Quick usage**:

```bash
# Requires: pip install Appium-Python-Client
# Requires: AWS CLI profile 'device-testing' configured

python3 scripts/device-farm/ios-safari-test.py https://pauseai.info
python3 scripts/device-farm/ios-safari-test.py https://deploy-preview-123--pauseai.netlify.app
```

**When to use**: After CSS changes affecting layout, especially full-bleed elements or negative margins. Playwright WebKit is not a reliable substitute for real iOS Safari.

**Cost**: 1000 free minutes/year, then ~$0.17/minute. Each test uses ~2-3 min.
